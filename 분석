Main\n","factors shown in the results include the the level of students’ understanding and necessity of subject special services\n","and subject special librarian, students’ willingness to work as a subject special librarian, the willingness to put\n","additional effort into equip themselves with competencies as subject special librarians. There were respondents who have\n","equipped competencies as subject special librarians through courses provided by the department of Library and\n","Information Science and school curriculum but have not done anything further. Respondents responded that there is a need\n","to systematize special status system of subject special librarian and that subject specialty is important in\n","implementing subject special services but that there is a lack of subject specialty. Based on the research results, this\n","study suggests that there is a need to put more emphasis on developing curriculum that can help overcoming difficulties\n","faced by students majoring in Information Sciecne and help them become competent subject special librarians.\n","====================================================================================================\n","A Study of Identifying Areas to Measure the Effectiveness of Public Library Reading Programs for Children\n","\n","The purposes of this study are to analyze the effectiveness of public library reading programs for children in\n","qualitative way and to apply the outcomes to identify areas to measure the success of library reading programs.\n","Interviews were conducted with children who participated in ‘2013 Reading Books with Libraries’ program and adults who\n","were in charge of managing the program. Observations on the program were also conducted. The findings indicate that\n","children who participated in ‘2013 Reading Books with Libraries’ program positively changed in various aspects. Selected\n","areas to measure the success of library reading programs include: reading behavior; attitude to books; awareness of\n","libraries and librarians; participation of library reading programs; the ability to read aloud; the ability to\n","comprehend stories by listening; aggression; the ability to express one’s own feelings; speech ability; concentration\n","power; and undiscovered potential. The elements that affect the success or failure of library reading programs include:\n","librarian’s enthusiasm on running the reading program; environmental condition of the community child care center; age\n","differences between child participants; running style of the instructor’s program; selection of books; child\n","participants’ reading abilities and interests in reading; available time for free voluntary reading.\n","====================================================================================================\n","An Analysis on Relations Between the Services of Public Libraries for Babies and Toddlers and Bookstart Program\n","\n","This study analyzed the services of libraries for babies and toddlers and the possibilities of service expansion through\n","Bookstart program as a cooperative system for libraries. This study shows how users change their way of using libraries\n","and their perceptions of the services of libraries for toddlers by implementing the questionnaire method and the\n","analysis of library statistics. Results show that most of library users (98.8%) expressed the need for Bookstart\n","program. Respondes also said that libraries, rather than other institutions, should be the place where the program is to\n","be implemented. By analyzing the perceptions of library users, we also find that they think that the age of the first\n","use of a library is more appropriate for toddlers than kindergarten-ages. We also found that library users who\n","participated in a Bookstart program had a positive change in the way they used libraries. After participating in\n","Bookstart programs, many changes occurred with respect to the perception of babies, reading habits of parents, and\n","users’ perception of libraries. After introducing Bookstart program, one city library’s membership enrollment rates of\n","babies and toddlers increased from 7.1% to 26.2%. But the rate for another city that did not participate in the program\n","was shown at 4.3%. This study suggests that the introduction of Bookstart program would bring changes and expansions to\n","the functions of libraries and the sometimes inflexible attitudes of library users. The study examined Bookstart program\n","as a cooperative system for libraries by changing the perception of library users and activating the services of\n","libraries for babies and toddlers.\n","====================================================================================================\n","A Study on Exploring the Services of Libraries for Babies and Toddlers and the Possibilities of Service Expansion through Bookstart\n","\n","This study explored the services of libraries for babies and toddlers and the possibilities of service expansion through\n","Bookstart as a cooperation system for libraries. This study presented the problems of the services of libraries for\n","toddlers by implementing the questionnaire method and the in-depth interviews. In addition, this study showed the impact\n","of carrying-out this program and why libraries should manage the Bookstart program. Results indicated that: (1) even\n","though the membership enrollment standard of children's libraries is usually from babies and toddlers up to the\n","elementary school students, that of a few libraries is still over elementary school students. This will work on\n","restraining the services of libraries for users, especially toddlers, only 54.8% of libraries services are for the\n","toddlers; (2) by analyzing the perception of librarians, we get to know that librarians think that the age of the first\n","use of a library is more appropriate for kindergarten-agers than toddlers; (3) librarians think positively about the\n","Bookstart and that libraries are more suitable for Bookstart than any other institutions; (4) after the introduction of\n","Bookstart to libraries, many changes happened in respect of the function of libraries and the types of users. For\n","examples, there was an expansion of users to babies and toddlers and their parents, an increase in users, focusing on\n","early-childhood reading education and the strengthening of the role of librarians as program planners in particular.\n","This study suggests that the introduction of Bookstart would bring changes to the concept of traditional libraries and\n","the inflexible attitudes of librarians.\n","====================================================================================================\n","Influence of Capacity Building and Attitude to Work of librarians in Edo State Public Libraries, Nigeria\n","\n","This study is on capacity building and attitude to work of librarians in Edo State public libraries, Nigeria.\n","Investigation was on the capacity building programs in the Edo State public libraries, the levels of librarians’\n","awareness and participation in the programs, methods of building the capacity programs, influence on the librarians’\n","attitudes to work and factors militating against the programs.

As results, many participants have visited the libraries with their family members, and have\n","applied the programs through the helps from their parents. They rated higher the service quality, the satisfaction, and\n","the loyalty than other child users of the children’s services as well as the adult participants of the cultural programs\n","and of the public libraries. In the analysis of the structural equation model (SEM) on the service quality, customer\n","satisfaction and loyalty, all of the service quality factors of special winter vacation programs, namely program\n","contents and instructors, staff supports and services, and facilities and equipments, have significant effects on the\n","user satisfaction.

The data were collected randomly from 220 librarians of public libraries in\n","Seoul by distributing and collecting internet surveys. Reliability analysis, correlation coefficient analysis, multiple\n","regression analysis, and regression analysis were performed using the SPSS 18.0 program. The statistic hypothesis test\n","results of this study can be summarized as follows. First, public library librarians did not like to express their\n","emotions to users, trying to express their emotions more positively than what they were actually feeling. Second,\n","although librarians experience emotional labors, they feel a sense of achievement when undertaking their tasks and\n","develop pride and happiness in their work. As librarians perceive their work professional, they overcome emotional\n","labors, and have pride in their work. Third, although librarians experience emotional labors, a reasonable job\n","evaluation with goals, and their relationships with colleagues would lead to accomplishment in their work. In addition,\n","although the evaluation of employees is focused on performance, librarians improve their service if library users are\n","satisfied with their service and the services are provided adequately.\n","====================================================================================================\n","An Analysis Research on User Satisfaction of Public Library Comparison between Korea and USA\n","\n","This research analyzed and compared the public library satisfaction level between South Korea and USA public library\n","user.

The results were, first, overall customer satisfaction level of USA average(m=3.91) was higher then South Korea\n","average(m=3.08) with a difference of m=0.83. Second, in the outcome of the survey conducted in South Korea, all four key\n","factors were strongly related to customer satisfaction level, whereas the survey conducted in the USA, only two key\n","factors showed relation to the customer satisfaction level which were facility and online service. Lastly, In the survey\n","conducted in South Korea, out of the four key factors, Faculty(β=.838) and online service(β=.496) were the only two key\n","factors that influenced the customer satisfaction level. In the survey conducted in the USA, Facility(β=.441) and online\n","service(β=.471) were the two key factors that influenced customer satisfaction level. Therefore, South Korea should\n","invest in increasing online service and educating faculty service as well as managing more intensively in software type\n","field policies.\n","====================================================================================================\n","A Study on the Perceived Importance of Digital Information Resources in Public Libraries\n","\n","The purpose of this study is to portray the current condition of digital reading rooms in public libraries in specific\n","terms of information resource constituencies. With the growth in numbers of public libraries in Korea, emphasis was also\n","put on digital information services using digital reading rooms in public libraries. However, it is also recognized that\n","these digital reading rooms are merely traditional reading rooms with equipment. In this regard, the objective for the\n","study was to identify and describe the types of electronic information resources in order to determine the rationale for\n","the development of digital information resource management in public libraries. The focus was especially put on\n","investigating the quality and the degree of perceived importance of electronic resources. Data for this case study was\n","collected from four relatively big public libraries in three cities. The investigation was conducted by the document\n","reviews and surveys and interviews with librarians and patrons.

The analysis revealed the problems\n","such as lack of human resources and budget, shortage of space, and an inflexible program curriculum, which affect the\n","program as a whole negatively. Five suggestions were made to remedy the problems. They are: 1) development of the new\n","programs, which can interest the children and youth and motivate the sense of association among the program\n","participants; 2) increase the number of the programs including the schools and other related organizations nearby\n","region; 3) incorporating the new program formats to enhance the participation; 4) starting the new services explicitly\n","targeted for the information-poor group of people; and 5) soliciting policy-level support for the libraries.

A comparative study of programs with user fees in North American and Danish public libraries\n","\n","Purpose - As a research topic within the field of LIS, programs in public libraries are underexplored, and the question\n","of user fees for programs has not previously been addressed. Design/methodology/approach - This article compares data\n","collected from two individually conducted studies of public library programs in North America and Denmark to enrich our\n","understanding of user fees in relation to programs. Findings - The comparative analysis shows both similarities and\n","deviations regarding the levying of fees for library programs. While paying a fee to attend a program is rather normal\n","in Denmark, it is more of a fringe idea in North America. Research limitations/implications - By exploring a previously\n","understudied facet of contemporary public librarianship, this article opens up new avenues for inquiry regarding how the\n","relative accessibility and availability of programs relate to theoretical discussions about programs as public library\n","services. Practical implications - This article provides library managers with needed information about how to\n","conceptualize the roles of programs as public library services. Social implications - As programming surges to the fore\n","in contemporary public librarianship, the levying of user fees has social implications in terms of social equity and the\n","public library ethos of free and equal access for all. Originality/value - This article is the first study of user fees\n","for public library programs, as well as among the first cross-national comparisons of programming as a dimension of\n","public librarianship.\n","====================================================================================================\n","A Comparative Study of the Perceptions on Public Libraries between Librarians and Users: A Survey of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education Public Libraries\n","\n","The purpose of this study was to provide basic information necessary for establishing library development plan and\n","service direction by comparing and analyzing the perception of librarian and user’s public library. For this purpose, a\n","questionnaire survey was conducted with 270 librarians and 820 public users of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of\n","Education Public Libraries regarding the current environment of the library, the role and status of the future library,\n","and the library policy. The results showed librarians viewed the long history and accumulated information resources as\n","strengths, while users had the highest satisfaction with human resources. As for the role of the public library and its\n","future status, both librarians and users perceived reading and education as more important, confirming that the two\n","groups had common expectations for public libraries. Yet the two groups had different perceptions about the policy for\n","enhancing future library roles.

We used qualitative content analysis to examine their form and content to identify common themes,\n","trends, and ideas. Public services librarians spend much of their time wrestling with nebulous topics such as service\n","quality, customer satisfaction, and user experience. Improvements in these areas necessitate strengthening the quality\n","of the service and the culture in which it's delivered. One approach to establish standards for consistent service\n","delivery is for libraries to implement service philosophy statements. A service philosophy statement also communicates\n","directly with users what they can-and should-expect from the library. Before we could develop and implement a service\n","philosophy statement at our respective libraries, we wanted to understand the specific ways that service philosophy\n","statements communicate service expectations to users. We will describe the series of steps we followed to conduct our\n","research, such as creating the coding frame, segmenting the data, pilot coding, evaluating and modifying the coding\n","frame, analyzing the data, and interpreting the findings.

Cleveland's Mean Green Science Machine focused on middle and high school-aged children while The Ohio\n","State University (OSU) Science Cafe in Columbus focused on preschool and elementary school-aged children for its summer\n","sessions. Recommendations for best practices for creating children's programming using STEM is provided.\n","====================================================================================================\n","A Research on the Characteristics of Children's OPAC Displays in Public Libraries\n","\n","The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of OPAC displays and search interfaces for children. The\n","OPACs of Cheongju Miracle Library, Nowon Children's Library in Seoul, Los Angeles Public Library in the U.S.A. and\n","HelMet Library System in Finland are examined on the basis of 'OPAC Display Guidelines(Draft)' published by IFLA and\n","Nielsen's 'User Interface Design Heuristics'. Discussed are such topics as the features of basic and detailed search\n","screens, the brief display of search results, the arrangement and full display of bibliographic records, and the\n","displays for zero-results and large retrieval sets. The OPAC displays of Cheongju Miracle Library and Nowon Children'\n","Library are not particularly designed to serve children which are their primary users. The OPAC displays for children of\n","LAPL and HelMet Library System are rather simplified and customized to represent specifically the needs and information\n","seeking behavior of children.\n","====================================================================================================\n","A Qualitative Research on the Bookstart for Infants and Toddlers: Focusing on the Bookstart of Public Library in Cheonan\n","\n","The bookstart program for infants and toddlers is still in experimental progress. From this qualitative research that\n","contains the both administration and utilization of the bookstart program at the Cheonan public library, some\n","necessities for improvement were found to be the more effective program. The administration staffs of program consist of\n","the supporting team and the instructional team. This program gives the meaningful experience to staffs such as the\n","satisfaction as supporters of caring infants and toddlers, extension of social participation, and developing\n","professionalism. The characteristic (purpose) of bookstart program for infants and toddlers could be categorized as\n","three: offering a place to plays with other infants and toddlers, opportunities to exchange practical information, and\n","chances to have educational support. To be more effective program, the difficulties and administrative problems of the\n","program should be solved.\n","====================================================================================================\n","A Study on Analyzing and Prospecting for the Future of the Public Libraries’ Cultural Programs in Seoul\n","\n","The objective of this study is to suggest a future direction for cultural programs in public libraries by literature\n","review and the investigation of the programs in practice in Seoul Metropolitan City from various perspectives. The\n","programs were categorized by their characteristics, such as subject, users, and managerial aspects based on the\n","literature review. Then we investigated their rates to total number of programs in order to identify trends in years.\n","There were two interesting points as follows: experience-centered and health education programs have been increasing in\n","terms of the subject, and participation-oriented programs in terms of managerial aspects has also been increasing. The\n","results led us to suggest strengthening the programs in those categories for future planning on public libraries’\n","cultural programs.\n","====================================================================================================\n","A Qualitative Evaluation Research on the Relationship Between Creative Thinking and an Infinite Creative Space Program\n","\n","This study developed a program suitable for operating an infinite creative space within the public library, and analyzed\n","the effect of promoting participants’ creativity through a trial run of the program.To do this, we operated a “picture\n","book making activities” program in the infinite creative space of J library located in Chungbuk. This program was\n","performed for 18 elementary students in grades 3-6.Torrance TTCT (The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking) tools were\n","used in this study to measure the overall creativity. As a result, first, awareness of the importance and interest in\n","environmental science was improved through the whole program process. Second, participants’ problem-solving abilities\n","improved during the program by having to derive a solution for a given problem through brainstorming.Third, storytelling\n","ability improved after the story-creating elements of the program. Fourth, each participants’ creativity was improved\n","through creative activities. Fifth, by publishing the results of creative activities of participants as books, the self-\n","esteem of participating children improved as well.\n","====================================================================================================\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def draw_line(data):\n","    types = ['Topic-1',
