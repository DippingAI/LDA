"Buschman, John","Public Libraries Are Doing Just Fine, Thank You: It's the Public in Public Libraries That is Threatened",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LIBRARY SCIENCE-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L INFORMATION ET DE BIBLIOTHECONOMIE,neoliberalism; public goods; public libraries; libraries; public libraries' support,"Public libraries have been rhetorically cast as being in crisis for decades as an outmoded, unaffordable institution in high-profile venues. However, when challenged as such, public libraries are vigorously defended, and an abundance of data on their actual popularity, usage, and value is deployed. We come to the question of why this mode of questioning persists despite the manifest value that the public places on public libraries. This article proposes a two-track answer by exploring (1) the long running context of neoliberalism and corrective to our understanding of it and (2) the status of publicness within neoliberalism. The article unpacks the concept of public and how it has changed and come under specific threat-informed by our more robust understanding of neoliberalism-over the last several decades. Data and arguments about public libraries and improved quality of life, community, cultural heritage, economic assistance during hard times, or their role as third places do not necessarily fall on deaf ears, but, to deploy a metaphor, those ears have been reengineered not to hear or value them.",2020
"Barclay, Donald A.",Space and the Social Worth of Public Libraries,PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY,Public libraries; library space; public library visits; value of public libraries,"In spite of the growth of digital information and the resultant questioning by some of the value of public libraries, library usage data indicate there were 497,600,000 more visits to public libraries in 2013 than in 1993. Why do people still visit public libraries in the digital age? While many factors drive people to visit public libraries, one thing that public libraries offer that cannot be duplicated online is physical space. Over the decades, library space has been the glue holding the library universe together even as the specific activities that take inside libraries have evolved. While public libraries do an excellent job of promoting their important role in providing access to information, educational resources, technology, and a host of valuable services, they must also promote the value of public library space itself. This requires more than trotting out numbers; it requires telling compelling stories of how public library space is used and reminding the public that the kind of spaces public libraries provide are, in fact, a vanishing resource. The post-911 tightening of security in public buildings of all sorts-coupled with the increasing privatization of what were once public spaces-has left public libraries as perhaps the last remaining indoor public spaces where an individual can remain from opening until closing without needing any reason to be there and without having to spend any money. Public libraries should promote the uniqueness of their spaces in much the same way that National Parks promote the unique spaces they preserve and make available to the public.",2017
"Widdersheim, Michael M.; Koizumi, Masanori",Conceptual modelling of the public sphere in public libraries,JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION,Public libraries; Politics; Public sphere; Library systems; Communication; Modelling,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to construct a conceptual model of the public sphere in public libraries. Various international authors over the past 20 years have associated the public sphere with public libraries, but these associations have yet to be clarified and synthesized in a comprehensive way. Design/methodology/approach - This study used qualitative content analysis to identify the dimensions of the public sphere in public libraries. The study's scope included annual reports from an urban US public library system from 1900 to 2010. Findings - Six dimensions of the public sphere in public libraries are described with examples. The dimensions are: core criteria; internal public sphere; external public sphere; collect and organize discourse; perform legitimation processes; and facilitate discourse. Three of these dimensions are newly identified. The six total dimensions are synthesized into a comprehensive conceptual model with three discourse arenas: governance and management; legitimation; and commons. Originality/value - This study is distinctive because it used a data-based, empirical approach to public libraries to an abstract sociological concept. Three dimensions of the model are new to library studies literature and therefore represent new potential areas of inquiry. The resulting conceptual model is useful for both practitioners and researchers in the public library sector. Further, the model contributes to existing social and political theory.",2016
"Jordan, Mary Wilkins",Competencies for public library managers: diversity in practice,LIBRARY MANAGEMENT,Leadership; Management; Public library; Public libraries; Competency development; Competencies,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify competencies in common across public library managers. Design/methodology/approach - The request for public library managers to participate in this survey was posted to the public listserve. Participants were asked about the tasks they do regularly, to identify the skills currently seen as most important in their work. They were then given a list of competencies, and asked to identify those they felt were most important for current public library managers, for those in future managers. Findings - Some commonalities emerged, but there was not a substantial amount of overlap between skills identified by directors and non-director managers as important now or into the future. Research limitations/implications - Further research into managerial competencies focussed on specific job titles is necessary to see what kinds of skills each may value. Likewise, a broader look at public library managers may provide a better set of common competencies that will be useful for both training and hiring. Practical implications - Understanding strategies for managerial competencies will be useful in building successful training programs. Social implications - Learning in this study that it will be challenging to carry out training relevant to all types of public library managers is useful; instead it can be tailored to different levels of managers for more success. Originality/value - This is an original study, building on other work the author has carried out. The value is in understanding the real needs of managers, not just anecdotal stories.",2015
"Fischer, Rachel K.",Human resource challenges for public libraries: survey results,PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY,Public library management; human resource management; public libraries; surveys,"This essay presents the major findings from a survey about human resource management in public libraries. The survey was conducted in October 2016 via the Internet. The participants were librarians with human resource management experience employed by public libraries in the United States. The majority of the participants responded that human resource management was challenging to some degree. While a majority were able to solve their human resource problems successfully, a majority of the respondents believed that the human resource curriculum for library science programs was inadequate.",2018
"Sikes, Scott",Rural Public Library Outreach Services and Elder Users: A Case Study of the Washington County (VA) Public Library,PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY,Rural public libraries; library outreach; elder users,"Outreach services provided by rural public libraries are crucial to fulfilling their mission to provide information access to the widest array of user groups. Particular socioeconomic and geographic factors in rural areas present challenges of access to information resources, yet there exists only a limited amount of published scholarly work examining outreach services provided specifically by rural public libraries. This case study of outreach services to elder users offers contextual evidence for the centrality of social equity and access to the larger work of rural public libraries. Primary data were collected through four semi-structured focus group meetings conducted with elder users of the agency's outreach services as well as through narrative interviews with six agency staff members. Principal findings showed that elder users had particular information needs related to entertainment and intellectual stimulation, challenges of transportation, and a limited access to technology and internet service. WCPL outreach services were found to positively impact the lives and general well-being of elder users by providing vital social and community connections and serving as a key link for elder users to an institution understood to be central to the life of the community in general.",2020
"Hoppenfeld, Jared; Malafi, Elizabeth",Engaging with entrepreneurs in academic and public libraries,REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW,Academic libraries; Business; Library services; Public libraries; Entrepreneurship; Library resources,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how academic and public libraries support entrepreneurial researchers and, in doing so, demonstrate impact and share best practices. Design/methodology/approach - The authors discuss their own experiences as academic and public business librarians who support entrepreneurs. They do so by revealing the main services they provide to this unique user group and presenting examples from their own institutions. They also present what is done at other libraries by way of a literature review and an informal survey. Findings - After navigating the landscape of business librarian support of entrepreneurs, many commonalities were found among the types of support offered. Most libraries in this study collaborate with a business incubator, center for entrepreneurship, office of economic development or small business development center in some fashion. Numerous outreach and networking efforts were found that had positive effects on the local and national economies. Although public and academic libraries have different base user groups, both types of libraries serve current and potential entrepreneurs, as well as students, who are looking for similar data in the same kinds of resources. Originality/value - Although specific examples can be found in the literature, little has been published that provides an overview of the entrepreneurial services and resources provided at numerous libraries of different types as well as resulting impact. This paper fills this gap and should provide new ideas to librarians of all kinds wishing to reach entrepreneurs.",2015

"Flaherty, Mary Grace; Kaplan, Samantha Jan",Health information: print materials assessment in public libraries,REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW,Public health; Public libraries; Information services; Health information; Assessment; Library materials,"Purpose - The purpose this study was to determine currency of print health materials readily available in North Carolina public libraries, through a statewide assessment. Two subject areas were examined: health reference and diabetes. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 30 randomly selected public libraries were visited and unobtrusive stacks assessments were completed. Some months later, the libraries' websites were examined for collection development policies, and online catalogs were searched using the keyword diabetes to identify possible discrepancies and additions. Findings - For visits, publication dates for reference books ranged from 1899-2014 and the average number of holdings was 10 (range 0-30). The most common reference item, the AMA Family Medical Guide (2005), was available in 6 of 30 libraries. In diabetes collections, publication dates ranged from 1983-2013; the average number of books was nine (range 0-26). The Atkins Diabetes Revolution (2004) was the most common, available in 9 of 30 libraries. Two-thirds of libraries did not have a collection development policy online. Catalog searches revealed 10 titles prior to 1983 and 18 titles (non-cook books) from 2014-2016. Practical implications - The study found overall that print health reference books were outdated. In diabetes collections, there were also many outdated items. It appears that regular weeding to assure currency of print health literature is not taking place. Originality/value - The study demonstrates that public libraries may not be providing optimal print health information. With unprecedented access, it is imperative that librarians in all types of settings aid in health literacy promotion by assuring access to reliable and timely health information.",2016

Design/methodology/approach - The paper defines advocacy in the context of GL, and explores the GL grant planning process, tools, and collaboration between advocacy and impact specialists. Results are demonstrated through grantee examples that illustrate a variety of approaches to library advocacy using impact data at local, country, and regional levels. Findings - The paper demonstrates the importance of identifying community needs, designing impact measures to demonstrate how libraries help to address those needs, and the variety of ways impact evidence can be used to effectively advocacy for public libraries. This basic formula can be applied to advocacy efforts ranging from a broad national policy to a small incremental change in perceptions of libraries by local decision makers. Originality/value - This paper reinforces the essential link between library impact measurement data and successful advocacy.",2015
"Lo, Patrick; Allard, Bradley; Wang, Na; Chiu, Dickson K. W.",Servant leadership theory in practice: North America's leading public libraries,JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE,North America; public librarianship; public libraries; public library management; servant leadership,"This study aims to understand the current North American public library directors' views and perceptions of successful library leadership in the 21st century. It was carried out based around a series of semi-structured interviews with 10 top-level directors of public libraries in the United States and Canada, which were published in the book World's Leading National, Public, Monastery and Royal Library Directors: Leadership, Management: Future of Libraries. The data collection method for this study consisted of narrative analysis of the 10 interviews utilizing Robert Greenleaf's servant leadership theory, which highlights the leader's desire to serve others first and foremost. With the current trends of increased globalization, digitization, and cultural diversity, among others, public libraries need to have leadership focused on creating shared-power environments encouraging collaboration. Analysis of these interviews showed that many of the directors' responses were quite similar to the concepts discussed in servant leadership. The library directors, through their leadership philosophies, benefited in boosting team cohesion, fostering collaboration, increasing creativity, and promoting morality-centered self-reflection amongst leaders, thereby helping their libraries gain and maintain competitive advantage, and improving the overall ethical culture of their organizations. The results of this study would be of interest to library professionals interested in management as well as LIS students who want to understand how library directors view successful traits of library leadership.",2020

"Carrigan, Dennis","Public Libraries, Dual Constituencies, and Marketing",PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY,public libraries; marketing; constituencies; exchange; segments,"Marketing can be a powerful tool for public libraries. However, to realize marketing's potential, it must be understood. Unfortunately, Marketing is a term used by librarians to mean many different things and therefore has become confusing (Doucett 2008, 1). Replacing confusion with clarity, which is especially important if the goal of marketing is to elicit financial and other support, requires answering two questions: What is marketing, and what is required for marketing to deliver the benefits it is capable of? Answers are sought before when marketing came to mean many different things and ... become confusing.",2015

Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses two methods. First, this study uses a systematic literature review to identify sources relevant to shared value and the public sphere in public libraries. Next, this study uses comparative theoretical analysis using data gathered from the systematic review to analyse the two theories. Findings - This study successfully describes the similarities and differences between shared value and the public sphere in public libraries. Originality/value - This study elucidates public library innovation from the perspectives of library management and the public sphere concept.",2016
"Arendt, Anne; Fife, Dustin",Impact of public domain resources on public libraries in the United States,JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE,CC0; copyright; creative commons; public domain; public libraries,"Ownership and rights issues relating to electronic resources can be a source of angst, confusion and litigation. This is due in part to the automatic copyright many individuals receive, including in the United States, upon creation of an original work. However, there are options available for relaxing these rights. One of these options is Creative Commons Zero. Essentially, Creative Commons Zero permits originators of materials of varying sorts to opt to put their creations into the public domain - waiving all copyright and intellectual rights. The ability for originators of works to place these items into the public domain affects not just that individual, but also all others who might make use of the resources or be affected by others who make use of the resources. One area likely to be both directly and indirectly impacted is libraries. After all, a public library is accessible by the public and contains a collection of materials or records kept for reference or borrowing and is generally funded from public sources. In the United States there are approximately 9225 public libraries (administrative entities) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (US Census Bureau, 2009). Based on the above, this document researches the awareness, complexity and effects of Creative Commons Zero and related licenses on libraries as perceived by library directors and managers across the United States. In order to accomplish this, a quantitative survey was administered in an anonymous web-based format.",2015
"Macdonald, Anne Therese",Dedicated business centers in public libraries,REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW,Entrepreneurs; Public libraries; Business reference services; Business services; Library services to business; Pubic library business centers,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not a dedicated business center within a public library acts as a key success factor in a public library's services to the community entrepreneur. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was sent to 88 public libraries with dedicated business centers, and posted to BRASS-L and BUSLIB-L, for input from public libraries without business centers. Interviews with three survey respondents and one local city official followed. Findings - Fifty-seven per cent of all respondents felt that a dedicated business center is very essential or essential to the services provided to the entrepreneurial community. The services most often offered were workshops/seminars/classes, counseling sessions by collaborative agencies and one-on-one research sessions with librarians. The majority of responding libraries collaborated with a community business agency (80 per cent). Fifty-one per cent spend between 6 and 20 hours/month on the collaboration. Research limitations/implications - Since 2007, many of the dedicated business centers in public libraries have closed or been consolidated with other sections and services of a public library. This should be further studied. Further research on librarian expertise in market and industry research is recommended. Originality/value - This study updates the business services associated with public libraries business services since the push in the late 1990s for public libraries to be more active in community economic development.",2015

Design/methodology/approach - Content analysis was used to explore statements of 84 public library directors and 45 mayors about what was most/least effective in a recent library budget request. Findings - Although they may differ on the relative importance of a specific concept, the public library directors and mayors in this study have high levels of agreement about what information is important in the budget decision process. Research limitations/implications - The primary limitations of the findings of this study stem from the reliability of self-reported data and the low response rates. While the researcher believes that the findings and conclusions are valid for the survey respondents, it is less certain that they are valid for all public libraries in New Jersey, and it is not recommended that the conclusions be extended to public libraries outside of the state which differ in state mandates and other circumstances. Practical implications - Understanding more about the factors that can influence library funding decisions provides insight into the very complex public library funding process and may help public library directors and mayors engage in mutually satisfactory budget negotiations. Originality/value - This study contributes to the Library and Information Science research literature on library budgets by examining influences on the public library funding decision, specifically adding the perspectives of mayors and public library directors on a recent budget cycle.",2016

However, at the same time, they are important social and community spaces in which community members can engage with each other. With this in mind, this study looks at the ways in which public libraries in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong fulfil these roles in their respective communities. The public libraries chosen for this study were namely: Shanghai Library, Taipei Public Library and Hong Kong Central Library. A total number of 788 responses were collected from all three libraries. Results from the surveys indicated that public libraries in these communities were seen as being important for providing cost-free materials, entertainment, and, especially, contributing to the overall culture of the community at large. Results indicated that the public libraries chosen for this study have social and cultural values alongside its function as an information centre. These findings will be important in understanding the sociocultural roles of public libraries in East Asia.",2019
"Faulkner, Ashley E.",Entrepreneurship resources in US public libraries: website analysis,REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW,Entrepreneurship; Small businesses; Public libraries; Business librarians; Business; Library websites,"Purpose This paper aims to explore the entrepreneurship resources patrons can discover and/or access on the web pages of the largest 46 US public libraries to assess the strength of public libraries' current support to their entrepreneur-patrons, and where, and by what means, public libraries may wish to expand, or further promote, their support. Design/methodology/approach The author completed a website analysis of the largest 46 US public libraries, as defined by the criteria in the ALA publication The Nation's Largest Public Libraries. Website analysis was completed via a standardized checklist assessment of each library website. Findings Public libraries often have print and electronic resources, meeting spaces and programming that could be of use to entrepreneur-patrons, but these resources are sometimes difficult to discover on library websites. Libraries have strong partnering relationships with other government and nonprofit organizations, but they may wish to expand these partnerships further. Practical implications Public libraries in the US often have multiple support services to offer entrepreneur-patrons. However, if libraries would like to reach entrepreneur-patrons beyond their walls, as well as within them, they may wish to consider further refining the resources both accessible via their website and promoted on it. Originality/value While there are research articles exploring how both academic and public libraries support entrepreneur-patrons, as yet, there has been no in-depth research into how public libraries support their entrepreneur-patrons through not only their in-library offerings but also the materials highlighted and/or available via their website. This research addresses this gap in the literature.",2018

Libraries and other public agencies have redesigned their practices to better serve the needs of these new segments of the population. The urban area chosen for this study has experienced one of the fastest growing Spanish speaking Populations in the country in the last 10 years. In this study, a needs assessment was created for the Spanish speaking Population served by a branch library in a large, urban area. The needs assessment was created with the use of demographic data and an analysis of current library literature. Using the assessment, the current Spanish nonfiction collection of the library was evaluated for both size and content and then compared to the size and content of the English nonfiction collection.

As this practice area grows, it is reshaping the way that libraries assist their patrons. Though the work of individual library social workers vary depending on the unique needs of their patrons and communities, there are some social work concepts that remain constant across the country. Conceiving of the library as a protective factor, particularly for vulnerable patrons, can be a helpful lens through which to view the ever changing needs of individuals and communities served by public libraries.

The results indicate that public library directors identify a number of reasons why storytime is important; prime among those are for encouraging children's enjoyment of books, promoting children's early literacy skills, and attracting patrons who might otherwise not participate in library services. The findings suggest that public library directors do not fully recognize how storytime programs might contribute to school readiness. Further, differences in library inputs to support storytime point to disparities based on library size. The implications for practice, education, and research are discussed.",2020

Library catalogs have traditionally been clunky, dated, and not particularly easy to use. Discovery layers entered the library market heavily in the late-2000s as a tool to seamlessly display and provide access to library resources. With new offerings from vendors and a number of open source options, libraries now have many options to provide a better interface. Different library types have different needs, and may, therefore, choose different catalogs for their patrons. One discovery layer stands out, however, both for its innovative features and for its ability to be customized to meet the needs of multiple types of libraries. Pika is the open source discovery layer developed by the Marmot Library Network. This paper will look at the experiences of an academic library and a public library and demonstrate how Pika has met the needs of both institutions.",2016

GIS uses maps as output mediums for displaying demographic or similar information, as well as for spatial comparison or spatially based analysis. This is useful for gaining knowledge as well as for decision making. This article reports research into the awareness and use of GIS-type systems in public library settings in hopes of better understanding the benefits, drawbacks, and limitations to use of systems such as these. Primary findings suggest that there continues to exist limited understanding of the capabilities of GIS technology in public libraries and therefore very little demand for it exists in public librarians and patrons alike.",2018

Using data from the Institute of Museum and Library Services National Public Library Survey, this study examined the relationships between the expenditures and resources of public libraries and children's and young adults' use. Three groups of variables were chosen from the dataset to represent expenditures, resources, and children's and young adults' library use respectively. Correlation analysis results reveal that most of the expenditures and resources variables were significantly correlated with children's and young adults' library use in libraries of all sizes. Further, analyses of material circulation and program attendance rates reveal that children's materials account for more than one-third of total library material circulations and 70% of public library program participants attend programs designed for children. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence to support the investment in library resources and services for children and young adults and are discussed in light of expansion of library services and programming focused on informal learning.",2019
"Pressley, Tara","Public Libraries, Serious Mental Illness, and Homelessness: A Survey of Public Librarians",PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY,Homelessness and public libraries; serious mental illness,The purpose of this survey was to investigate the perceptions that public librarians have of their user populations with regard to serious mental illness and its relationship to homelessness. The results found that a large number of public librarians experience concerns about the impact of such users upon other users and about the potential violence in these populations. Public librarians who took the survey expressed an interest in learning more about serious mental illness and a wish to achieve greater awareness of serious mental illness that could help them in their interactions with users who are experiencing serious mental illness.,2017

When we multitask, we work on two or more tasks and switch between those tasks. Multitasking is the way most of us deal with the complex environment we all live in, and recent studies show that people often engage in multitasking information behaviours. Multitasking information behaviours are little understood, however, and an important area of research for information behaviour research. Our study investigated the multitasking information behaviours of public library users at the Brentwood and Wilkinsburg Public Libraries in Pittsburgh through diary questionnaires. Findings include that some 63.5 percent of library users engaged in multitasking information behaviours, with a mean of 2.5 topic changes and 2.8 topics per library visit. A major finding of our study is that many people in libraries are seeking information on multiple topics and are engaged in multitasking behaviours. The implications of our findings and further research are also discussed.",2007

Using data from a national survey of public library professionals, the current study examined the growing STEM movement by measuring STEM-readiness and through the lens of Diffusion of Innovations Theory. Results indicate that most libraries are ready to implement STEM programing. Characteristics of STEM-ready libraries included serving more patrons, having more space, and engaging more often with STEM programing. Such findings suggest that public libraries that have access to resources are more likely to be STEM-ready; whereas, those with fewer resources may need additional support.",2019

The current study investigated the nature of language use in public library storytimes as an initial step in determining their potential to contribute to the vocabulary and oral language development of young children. The study employed textual analysis methods with 22 storytime transcripts to identify token and type counts, the most frequent words spoken by participating librarians and children respectively, the major grammar elements present, and the top 20 nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Results suggest that librarians dominate storytime communication with language that is highly repetitive and complex, yet centered on children and cognitively accessible for them. Further, storytimes seem to promote cognitive and behavioral skills necessary for school success such as counting and exposure to foundational concepts like colors, size, and position.",2020

In advance of Cleveland premieres of new films, CPL received promotional materials from the producers of the films to prepare bookmarks and exhibits that served the dual purpose of advertising the picture and drawing CPL patrons to library materials that related in some way to the films. Local movie theatre owners also sponsored the printing of bookmarks listing these related resources and helped to distribute them at their theatres and other public locations around the region. Through these 'movie tie-ups', the library hoped to guide Clevelanders to the best books and increase circulation. Lasting more than three decades, the programme was hugely influential on similar programmes established elsewhere and serves as a fascinating early example of private-public cooperation.",2017

This multi-method case study tested the applicability of a wayfinding framework developed in architecture to a public library environment. Research methods included unobtrusive observation of a random sample of users' wayfinding in the facility and interviews with a convenience sample of users to discuss their wayfinding behavior. Patrons used various wayfinding behaviors in the facility, some corresponding to the framework, but other behaviors did not fit into the existing framework and not all aspects of the framework were observed or expressed. Additional research is necessary to investigate more fully the degree to which the framework validly describes how library users wayfind. Results have value for librarians, architects and interior designers, all of whom may apply findings toward their work designing facilities that are intuitive to navigate.",2018

Library design changed gradually throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, and more dramatically with automation and new technology. True to its roots, the public library continues to maintain areas for quiet, individual study. But, in addition, today's library has become a cultural center in the community, offering art galleries, auditoriums, meeting rooms, spaces for collaborative work, digital information and instruction, and even cafes. Change is inevitable, as innovations in library design and patron use illustrate. Yet, from the earliest libraries to modern times, one overarching constant defines their purpose: libraries inspire.",2019

In contrast to these approaches, public sphere theory emphasizes the political and social justice aspects of public libraries. Existing library literature has established strong associations between public sphere theory and public libraries, and a tentative model of the public sphere in public libraries has been developed. It is not yet clear, however, how a public sphere model of public libraries might benefit the profession. This paper therefore explains how a conceptual model of the public sphere in public libraries can serve as a potential framework and research agenda for the public library sector. A model of the public sphere in public libraries contains three main arenas of discourse: governance, legitimation, and commons. Each of the arenas represents values that are central to public librarianship. Practitioners and scholars in the public library sector can use the public sphere model to orient research and practice. This paper explains each arena in detail and discusses the model's relevance as a philosophy and research agenda.",2015

A new theory is needed to explain public library development, one that foregrounds political processes. To produce this new theory, a historical case study was conducted of a regional public library system in the United States from 1924 to 2016. Multiple data sources and mixed methods were used to identify the causes of library development in nine periods of the case. Findings indicate that public libraries develop in a cyclical way. Within each decision cycle, high responsiveness is a necessary condition for a change in development. A responsive library system adapts to and acts upon discursively-legitimated issues. High responsiveness, together with either high civil support, high legitimacy or low resistance, are causal configurations sufficient for change. This theory is significant because it is testable, it uses a new research framework and new methods, and it provides new insight into public library development.",2018

It soon became clear, however, that not all users received the type of information, instruction, or services that they needed through this arrangement, giving rise to the need for an intermediary in this continuum of interaction. Increasingly, public libraries fulfill this role. Instead of direct government-to-user interaction, government information and services flow through channels from agency to public librarian to user, from user back up to agency, and from agency to user to public librarian. Based upon research conducted in collaboration with public libraries, government agencies, state library agencies, and a national library association in the United States, this paper expands on the idea of these multiple pathways of information and services, offering a practical model of e-government.

Clinical variables from the medical records were combined with library usage variables from the public library patron database. The authors analysed how patient health characteristics were associated with library cardholding, average card use or recency of use. ResultsApproximately 72% of participants held a library card; 40% of these had used it within the last month. Library cardholding was not associated with patient characteristics. Higher average card use was associated with pregnancy, having youth at home and depression severity. Lack of recent library usage was associated with current smoking (P = 0.01) and drug use (P = 0.01). Among ever-smokers, moderate/high card use and card use within six months were both associated with over two times the odds of quitting smoking.

One pertinent, currently unanswered question is whether library Internet access leads to increasing residential broadband adoption rates in the communities that the libraries serve. This paper uses simple county-level regression analysis to document a positive association between a higher number of libraries and household broadband adoption rates as of 2013 but only in rural areas. This correlation does not imply causation, however. A propensity score matching technique is used to demonstrate that counties with libraries that aggressively increased their number of Internet-accessible computers between 2008 and 2012 did not see measurably higher increases in their rates of residential broadband adoption. These findings lend themselves to future research questions including how to appropriately measure broadband 'adoption' outside of the home and methods for engaging library patrons that ultimately encourage residential broadband adoption.

To understand citizens' learning needs, this study uses public library circulation data. This study is significant because such data use is often unavailable in Japan. This data was used to clarify citizens' learning interests. Circulation data was compared from two libraries in Japan: Koto District Library in Tokyo and Tahara City Library in Aichi Prefecture. The data was used to identify general learning needs while also accounting for regional differences. The methodology and results of this research are significant for the development of lifelong learning policy and programming.",2020

Libraries in half of all 100 counties were chosen through a random, geographically systematic process, and structured interviews were completed with library directors. Twenty directors were interviewed, representing 28 counties. All reported their communities were affected; nine reported direct impacts on library function. Fifteen directors felt libraries should be involved in response; some felt Narcan administration was beyond library purview. Two libraries reported having Narcan available; five reported providing staff training. Given librarians' willingness to respond, it is time to provide necessary support for those efforts.",2020
"Prestamo, Anne M.; Bashir, Faiza; Soroya, Saira Hanif; Khanum, Almas",USERS' SATISFACTION AS A VALID MEASURE FOR INFORMATION RESOURCES: A CASE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES,JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION,public libraries; information resources; user satisfaction; information quality,The mission of public libraries is to serve the unique needs of their local communities. Public library User's play a very vital role in the development of these libraries by suggesting or recommending additions to the collection. This study aims to evaluate the satisfaction of users with the quality and quantity of library collection. A self structured questionnaire based on open and close ended question was constructed. A purposive sample of one hundred users was selected. The data were qualitatively analyzed using a thematic approach. Positive opinion observed related to the library response towards the suggested titles. Almost half the population of respondents was satisfied with the availability of their suggested titles in library. Most of them were dissatisfied regarding the maintenance of equal collection of books and they are not encouraged by the library staff during the books suggestion process. It concludes that there is a need to evaluate the existing library collections.,2018

This article presents and analyzes a survey of authors participating in programming at the Woodneath Library Center/Woodneath Press. It also presents and analyzes the results of a survey of public librarians. Findings suggest that self-publishing authors in this case study would benefit from author services support, and that librarians require targeted training to provide such support. As libraries explore this potential new role, more needs to be done to support author services in public libraries appropriately.",2016

Our study looked at strategies to ease managerial transitions between libraries, focusing on knowledge management, communities of practice, and mentorship. Our survey found that succession planning was dictated by local practice and size of library. The results of this paper inform knowledge of succession planning and reveal existing gaps between informal transfer of knowledge and structured knowledge management (KM), as well as librarians' resourcefulness.

"Matusiak, Krystyna K.",User Navigation in Large-Scale Distributed Digital Libraries: The Case of the Digital Public Library of America,JOURNAL OF WEB LIBRARIANSHIP,case study; Digital Public Library of America; discovery of digital collections; information behavior; large-scale digital libraries; user studies,"This article presents the findings of a case study that examined user navigation in a large-scale digital library in the context of academic use. Using the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) as a case, the study explored user navigation and understanding of a distributed model of large-scale digital libraries. The DPLA model involves two-or three-step navigation pathways. Most study participants could navigate the DPLA distributed, multilayered system effectively. This study found some confusion among the participants when they must move through a three-step process to locate digital objects provided by a metadata aggregator service hub. The study participants also pointed out the advantages of a distributed model in collocating digital resources and connecting users to a wide range of digital libraries.",2017
"Decker, Emy Nelson",Baby Boomers and the United States public library system,LIBRARY HI TECH,Public libraries; Attitudes; Computers; Customer orientation; United States of America; Baby boomer generation,"Purpose - The members of the Baby Boom generation, who comprise a very large, diverse, and outspoken sector of the population, are about to grow older and enter the public library. Are public libraries in the USA ready to accommodate their changing needs? The number of Baby Boomers, soon to be in the older adult category, will be unprecedented. Never before has there been such a sharp increase in the number of older adults. In addition, this group of users will have particular needs of their public libraries. This paper aims to focus on the issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper explores the specific needs that the Baby Boom generation will have of the US public library system by focusing on three specific, albeit interrelated, categories: social, programming, and technological, and offers methods for keeping these vital members of society engaged with their public libraries. Findings - This paper provides insights into possible solutions for maintaining and enhancing the public library's role as an important cultural center in the community for the aging population.

Design/methodology/approach - Content analysis of public library websites in the USA informed the development of a Strategic Diversity Manifesto that includes the who, the what and the how components to describe and discuss diversity-related matters in their strategic planning and web representations. Findings - The Strategic Diversity Manifesto provides a mechanism for individual public library agencies, in their localized context and environment, to strategically inquire, describe, discuss, reflect, analyze and translate into concretized actions their picture of diversity as grounded in the reality of their representative communities. Originality/value - The Strategic Diversity Manifesto presents a more a comprehensive and consolidated picture of diversity beyond isolated strategies seen in past efforts. It is a broader level of analysis and picture painting of the agency's context, which may not be as detailed as compared to other modes of description, though as a result, it is more holistic instead of fragmentary. The aim is first and foremost to provide a basis for reflective thought and discussion.",2015
"Lenstra, Noah; Mathiasson, Mia Hoj",Free and for all? A comparative study of programs with user fees in North American and Danish public libraries,LIBRARY MANAGEMENT,Library finance; Charging; User fees; Public librarianship; Library programs; Comparative study,"Purpose - As a research topic within the field of LIS, programs in public libraries are underexplored, and the question of user fees for programs has not previously been addressed. Design/methodology/approach - This article compares data collected from two individually conducted studies of public library programs in North America and Denmark to enrich our understanding of user fees in relation to programs. Findings - The comparative analysis shows both similarities and deviations regarding the levying of fees for library programs. While paying a fee to attend a program is rather normal in Denmark, it is more of a fringe idea in North America. Research limitations/implications - By exploring a previously understudied facet of contemporary public librarianship, this article opens up new avenues for inquiry regarding how the relative accessibility and availability of programs relate to theoretical discussions about programs as public library services. Practical implications - This article provides library managers with needed information about how to conceptualize the roles of programs as public library services. Social implications - As programming surges to the fore in contemporary public librarianship, the levying of user fees has social implications in terms of social equity and the public library ethos of free and equal access for all. Originality/value - This article is the first study of user fees for public library programs, as well as among the first cross-national comparisons of programming as a dimension of public librarianship.",2020
"Gomez, Ricardo; Gould, Elizabeth","The cool factor of public access to ICT Users' perceptions of trust in libraries, telecentres and cybercafes in developing countries",INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE,Trust; Public libraries; Communication technologies; Internet,"Purpose - This paper aims to determine how trust and perceptions shape uses of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in public access venues (libraries, telecentres, and cybercafes) in 25 developing countries around the world. Design/methodology/approach - As part of a global study conducted by the Technology & Social Change Group at the University of Washington, local research teams conducted surveys, site visits, and interviews of over 25,000 respondents in different types of public access venues in the selected countries, using a shared research design and analytical framework. Findings - The use of public access venues is shaped by the following trust factors: safety concerns, relevance of the information, reputation of the institution, and users' perceptions of how cool these venues are. While libraries tend to be trusted as most reputable, telecentres tend to be trusted as most relevant to meet local needs, and cybercafes tend to be perceived as most cool. Research limitations/implications - The paper is limited by its descriptive and not predictive nature, and is not based on a statistically representative sample of the population. Practical implications - The insight presented in this paper can help inform policy decisions about public access initiatives, and inform future research to better understand the causes and consequences of trust in public access ICT. Understanding these perceptions helps gain a more nuanced understanding of the way services are provided in venues that offer public access to ICT. Originality/value - This paper is novel as it covers public access to IT in 25 developing countries across different types of venues, using a shared design and methodological approach. A study of this magnitude has never been done before. The findings provide valuable insight into understanding how people trust different types of public access ICT venues.",2010

A content analysis of library announcements relating to the COVID-19 pandemic posted during the period of March 14-April 12, 2020, was performed. Over 90 percent of libraries announced a closure due to the pandemic and 98 percent libraries indicated programs were suspended. Over half of libraries posted about COVID-19 and general hygiene practices. Many announcements changed in terms of content from March 14 to April 12, demonstrating the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic. This study suggests that libraries can and do play an important role in providing reliable information about pandemics like COVID-19 for patrons.",2020
"Park, Jung-ran; Li, Guisu; Burger, Amy",Opening and closing rituals of the virtual reference service of the Internet Public Library,JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION,Interpersonal communications; Internet; Public libraries; Virtual organizations; Reference services,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the communicative rituals of opening and closing manifested in e-mail-based Internet Public Library's (IPL's) online reference interaction. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 400 transcripts comprising user queries and responses by IPL librarians are examined. The opening and closing elements are identified to examine the way in which 1PL librarians and users construct social space; that is, communicate their interpersonal and affective stances during the course of seeking and offering information. Findings - The results of data analysis show regular patterns of verbal and structural politeness indicators of opening and closing e-mail discourse. Linguistic elements such as greetings and acknowledgement are included in all the sampled transcripts; i.e. a 100 percent occurrence. Closing rituals have a 95 percent occurrence of linguistic features such as acknowledgement and invitation for follow-up. In contrast, there is a low occurrence of personalized openings through greeting by user name (26 percent). This lack of personalization also occurs in closings: personalized farewell through use of librarian name appears in only 8 percent of closings. Research limitations/implications - The employment of the various politeness tactics in opening and closing reflects the librarian's attention and concern to user's information needs, interests and wants. Such communicative competence narrows social distance and brings forth close socio-interpersonal space for interaction; this may, in turn, improve the overall quality of reference service. Research findings also indicate that more use of personal names may decrease the social distance between the librarian and user, resulting in increased solidarity and proximity. Originality/value - The study provides new insights into linguistic politeness and the functions of address forms such as personal names with a view toward developing effective opening and closing rituals that contribute to the enhancement of virtual reference services.",2010

Tapping into this renewed enthusiasm for the library built form, this article analyses evidence collected by the Mass-Observation Archive (MOA) in response to a request for written commentary on public library buildings, an investigation commissioned by the author. The MOA contains evidence, stretching back to the 1930s, of the British public's daily lives and attitudes. The Archive's data-collection method takes the form of essay-style contributions, varying from a few sentences to thousands of words, submitted from anonymous volunteer correspondents. A total of 180 essays (from 121 women and 59 men) were received, and all were read and analysed for the purpose of this study. Analysis focused on the tension between old and new styles of library design. It was found that while some people prefer public library buildings to retain their historic style and feel, others demand contemporary designs like those employed in recent years for new, 'flagship' buildings in Norwich, Peckham, Brighton and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. A third category of opinion expressed a taste for the provision of up-to-date facilities and interior decoration in historic settings. A fourth strain of thought - the essence of which might be described as 'libraryness' - played down the importance of style, whether old or new, foregrounding the importance of services and collections. The second half of the article offers a discussion that places the MOA evidence in the context of an assessments of, and commentaries on, recent public library design.",2011
"Hunt, Laura Kelly Clark",Caregivers' Motivations for Attending Emergent Literacy Programming in Public Libraries: Qualitative Analysis of Three Case Studies,PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY,Emergent literacy; children's programming; motivation; public libraries,"Public libraries are an important resource for emergent literacy development. Emergent literacy is the behavior a child exhibits relative to books and reading before the child is able to decode words. A distinctive feature to public libraries is the free and equal access they offer to the public and specifically caregivers of very small children. Libraries house large quantities of print and electronic resources that give children the opportunity to have meaningful literacy experiences that are necessary for reading development. These experiences have a significant impact on emergent literacy development. While literature demonstrates the importance of public libraries for small children, caregivers may not know about the impact of print-rich environments on emergent literacy skills. These interviews with caregivers reveal that most of them attend public library-emergent literacy programming for many other reasons than developing emergent literacy skills and exposure to a print-rich environment.",2020

Research exists that discusses public library connectivity by investigating funding, technical aspects, and library mission, and that also promotes membership in regional or state consortia as a means of making broadband internet connections more affordable. The research discussed here builds upon these works by asking the question: Do the benefits of aggregation, or pooling demand, justify the investment of state library resources in establishing and maintaining a library cooperative to support internet access? It reports on a survey of Indiana public library directors on questions related to connectivity, E-rate funding, and participation in the Public Library Internet Consortium, a statewide cooperative established by the Indiana State Library.

Previously controversial topics have become much more widely accepted. We find that other controversies remain, showing how global conflicts become intertwined in local cultural controversies, and how the perceived threat from particular groups informs public concern with disseminating information from those groups. We find that more frequent library users are somewhat less likely to want to remove controversial books from the shelves, although some of these relationships are explained by variation in the respondent's age, race, and other characteristics.",2016

In addition, LIS research on LGBTQ patrons has centered on collection development how-tos and high level, broad suggestions without evaluating the actual state of the libraries' resources and services to these patrons. In this analysis, I found that what primarily affected what the libraries had on their shelves was an actively engaged librarian dedicated to proper collection development practices.

The authors further investigated the effects of three library factors, namely, staff size, budget and urbanization degrees, on Facebook content and user engagement based on multilevel generalized linear modeling. Design/methodology/approach This study suggested a novel method, a combination of the bi-term topic modeling and MGLM, to enhance the understanding of social media in the context of public libraries. Findings The findings revealed that posts related to community events, awards and photos were likely to receive more likes and shares, whereas posts about summer reading programs received relatively more comments. In addition, the authors found that a larger staff size and the inclusion of multimedia had positive impacts on user engagement. Originality/value This study analyzed the content of public library-generated social media based on text mining.

From the perspective of analysing Chinese writing and its cultural, social, and political impact, this article attempts to deliver a tentative and speculative exploration concerning why public libraries did not automatically emerge from Chinese civilization. This article discusses how Chinese writing, characterized by the art form calligraphy, was intimately associated with Chinese classical texts, knowledge classification, bibliographers, and imperial libraries and eventually with an elite culture empowered by the sociopolitical repertoire of scholar-officials. It particularly focuses on the discussion of how 'public' is viewed differently in Chinese culture than in the West and how Chinese society, including libraries, was transformed by redefining the meaning of 'public' at the beginning of the twentieth century.",2017

In particular, this paper illustrates how the development of libraries in South Africa both reflected and influenced information poverty and has as its goal to increase awareness of the role of libraries in the alleviation of information poverty. Design/methodology/approach - The information in this paper is based on doctoral research completed by the author who investigated the role of libraries in the alleviation of information poverty in South Africa. The methodology for the research included two case studies, interviews, examination of library records, and observation. An extensive review of the professional literature and recorded histories provided imperative context for that research and this paper. Findings - Findings indicate that libraries can play an important role in the alleviation of information poverty in South Africa. Libraries are underutilized in this role and in order to increase their capacity in addressing information poverty, one should consider the historical circumstances behind the dispossession of library services. Understanding the development of libraries in South Africa and sociopolitical ramifications of this development can encourage and inform greater participation of libraries in the alleviation of information poverty in the future. Originality/value - This paper compiles the work and findings of previous studies on the history of South African libraries. The information provided here offers an accessible and efficient history of libraries in South Africa. In so doing, it provides context that is invaluable to the understanding of how the development of libraries throughout time can have sociopolitical effects on the people and their circumstances. The paper also encourages increased understanding of the value and purpose of libraries in combating information poverty in South Africa.",2018

Today, fueled by novel technologies, the landscape is vastly different, with patrons' privacy threatened by an ever-increasing number of entities. In this complexity, libraries have continued their commitment to privacy, with public libraries now seeking to educate patrons about privacy threats, protective measures, and tools that they might employ. This review of literature seeks to identify challenges to United States public libraries in educating and advocating for patron use of privacy-protection technology tools, drawing from research in a variety of allied fields, while suggesting future research directions. Issues identified include: substantial technology-related knowledge gaps in our patrons, librarians, and library staff; the need to support a vast number of technology tools and techniques; as well as building our understanding of the perspective of the tools' underlying creators.",2018

Tennessee's rural residents, especially in its Appalachian counties, face debilitating economic and social challenges such as inadequate financial prospects, information poverty, unemployment and low degrees of information literacy and educational attainment. The article presents findings from interviews and focus groups with 25 public library small business liaison representatives gathering input about their needs, expectations and experiences with rural public libraries. The foci are the existing and proposed ways rural public libraries provide small business assistance and identify components of a Public Library Small Business Toolkit, an ideal resource that Tennessee's rural public libraries can implement for small businesses in the future, with the end goal to further ways for rural public libraries to contribute towards economic development in Tennessee. Findings reveal existing roles of rural public libraries in providing physical space and resource assistance for categorized information on government, finance, insurance, taxes and rules/requirements while proposed roles extend to development of tailored skill trainings, start-up services and local information coordination. Future research considerations for public library small business liaisons are also discussed so they can extend assistance to small businesses in Tennessee and other parts of the country.",2017

The distribution of libraries is examined using maps and spatial statistics to analyze spatial patterns. Methods for delineating and studying library service areas used in previous LIS research are modified and applied using geographic information systems to study variations in library accessibility by state and by socio-economic group at the national level. A history of library development is situated within the broader economic and demographic history of the US to provide insight to contemporary patterns, and Louis Round Wilson's Geography of Reading is used as a focal point for studying historical trends. Findings show that while national library coverage is extensive, the percentage of the population that lives in a library's geographic service area varies considerably by region and state, with Southern and Western states having lower values than Northeastern and Midwestern states.",2014
"Stauffer, Suzanne","Utilizing This New Medium of Mass Communication: The Regional Film Distribution Programme at the Cleveland Public Library, 1948-1951",LIBRARY & INFORMATION HISTORY,public libraries; motion picture; educational films; documentary films; audiovisual materials,"In 1948, the Carnegie Corporation made grants of $25,000 to the Cleveland Public Library and $15,000 to the Missouri State Library to set up three-year regional educational film distribution programmes in northern Ohio and in Missouri of 16 mm reel-to-reel motion picture films. In Cleveland, films were distributed within a consortium of ten library systems in the region; twenty library systems participated in Missouri. These successful programmes served asmodels for other library systems and lasted well into the last quarter of the twentieth century, when 16 mm reel-to-reel motion picture films in libraries were replaced with videocassettes and later DVDs and the programmes were no longer necessary. This paper explores the antecedents of the programme at the Cleveland Public Library as well as the careers of the two women, Patricia Blair and Virginia Beard, who were responsible for the design of the programme and for its success. Both became nationally recognized experts on the use of 16 mm films in public libraries and rose to national prominence in the American Library Association.",2017

The Reasons Why Adults Bring Young Children to Public Library Storytimes",LIBRI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION STUDIES,storytime; public library programs; children's services; survey research,"While storytime programs for preschool children are offered in nearly all public libraries in the United States, little is known about why adults choose to bring children to participate. This survey study gathered information from 346 parents and caregivers who attended storytime programs at 35 public libraries in three states. Parents and caregivers indicated child enjoyment of hearing stories and participating in activities and the opportunity for children to interact as the primary reasons for attending; however, differences in motivation to attend were noted by community density, relationship to the child, educational level of the adult, and length of attendance. In addition to identifying those aspects of storytimes that resonate most for children and building upon them, librarians should integrate cooperative activities that facilitate interaction. Further, librarians should take stock of their own contexts and modify programs to best address the needs of their specific community.",2020
"Yoo-Lee, EunYoung; Rhodes, Tamara; Peterson, Gabriel M.",Hispanics and public libraries Assessing their health information seeking behaviors in the e-health environment,REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW,User studies; Public libraries; Health education; Ethnic minorities; Health literacy; Information needs and uses,"Purpose - The fastest-growing and the largest minority group in the USA, Hispanics are known to have low health literacy because of their limited English proficiency (LEP) and other socio-economic and cultural factors. This paper aims to examine the health information-seeking behaviors of Hispanics in the e-health environment and their use of public libraries as a health information source/service. Design/methodology/approach - An interviewer-administered survey was conducted using a semi-structured instrument. The questionnaires inquired about Hispanics' health information needs, source use and source preference; use of the library for health information needs; and their perceptions and satisfaction about the library's consumer health information services. A total of 26 Hispanics were recruited from a Hispanic community organization, a public library and an ethnic grocery store in North Carolina. Findings - The majority of the participants are foreign born (92.3 per cent) and non-English speakers (84.6 per cent). The internet was the most frequently used source, followed by friends/family, doctors and TV. Eighty-one per cent of the participants were internet users, and most of them (71 per cent) used the internet at home. Only 23 per cent visited a public library to search the internet for health information. Some barriers to using a public library mentioned by the participants include lack of time to visit a library, lack of skills in using the library materials, transportation, LEP, lack of eligibility for a library card, etc. Social implications - The findings will be useful for libraries and state/federal health services to evaluate and develop library services suitable for the Hispanics' consumer health information needs. Originality/value - This study is one of a few studies that use an empirical study of a low health literacy ethnic population to examine the possible roles of public libraries in enhancing health literacy.",2016

This review demonstrated that websites at land-grant libraries affirmed unaffiliated patrons' building access privileges at slightly higher rates and circulation privileges at lower rates than non-land-grant APLUs. Data also revealed that requirements and fees for library privileges varied across APLU libraries as a whole. This research is a first step in identifying how libraries at land-grants and non-land-grant APLUs compare to one another and to different types of institutions in the services they provide to unaffiliated patrons. It also continues the discussion of whether libraries, especially those at land-grant colleges and universities, have an obligation to open their spaces and collections to unaffiliated patrons.",2019
"Stenstrom, Cheryl",Decision-making experiences of public library CEOs A study exploring the roles of interpersonal influence and evidence in everyday practice,LIBRARY MANAGEMENT,Managers; Canada; Public libraries; Interpersonal influence; Evidence-based practice; Decision-making practices,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore and describe the decision-making practices of public library managers in the context of interpersonal influence and evidence-based information sources, and to investigate the relationship between models of evidence-based practice and interpersonal influence in the decision-making process of public library managers. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through short audio blog posts participants made about their everyday decisions and coded considering the facets of three existing evidence-based library and information practice (EBLIP) models as well as the facets of interpersonal influence. Findings - The findings show that public library CEOs decision-making behaviours reflect the use of a variety of practices from analytical to intuitive as is expected of managers in any sector; however, a stronger reliance on gathering objective information may be present than in other sectors. Seeking multiple sources of information and a tendency towards rationalism may indicate a more sophisticated approach to decision making, but be less indicative of the practices employed more broadly. A possible outcome of these tendencies may result in discordance with external partners and collaborators. Practical implications - The findings from this study may inform the work of associations, library and information science (LIS) educators, and library managers in developing strategic directions and instructional strategies within their organisations. It is also the first study to jointly examine models of interpersonal influence and evidence-based decision-making practices in any field. Originality/value - While the study of the decision-making practices of various groups is growing, little previous research has been conducted with public library managers, and none has been undertaken in Canada.",2015

Three research questions guided the study: current level of commenting in library blogs; librarians' perception of comment spam; and techniques used to address the comment spam problem. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach is used to investigate research questions. Informal interviews were conducted with four academic and three public libraries with active blogs to develop a better understanding of the problem and then to develop an appropriate data collection instrument. Based on the feedback received from these blog administrators, a survey questionnaire was developed and then distributed online via direct e-mailing and mailing lists. A total of 108 responses were received. Findings - Regardless of the library type with which blogs were affiliated with and the size of the community they served, user participation in library blogs was very limited in terms of comments left. Over 80 percent of libraries reported receiving five or fewer comments in a given week. Comment spam was not perceived to be a major problem by blog administrators. Detection-based techniques were the most commonly used approaches to combat comment spam in library blogs. Research limitations/implications - The research focuses on the comment spam problem in blogs affiliated with libraries where the library is responsible for content published on the blog. The comment spam problem is investigated from the library blog administrator's perspective. Practical implications - Results of this study provide empirical evidence regarding level of commenting and the impact of comment spam in library blogs. The results and findings of the study can offer guidance to libraries that are reconsidering whether to allow commenting in their blogs and to those that are planning to establish a blog to reach out to their users, while keeping this online environment engaging and interactive. Originality/value - The study provides empirical evidence that level of commenting is very limited, comment spam is not regarded as an important problem, and it does not interfere with the communication process in library blogs.",2011

Utilizing statistics to describe and assess the comparative operation of library activities has become a part of library tradition and has received growing attention in the past two decades from researchers, policy makers, library managers, and professionals. However, studies about how statistics are used in libraries have been scant. We conducted a survey to investigate public library directors' use of the Federal-State Cooperative System for Public Library Data (FSCS) and the Public Library Data Service (PLDS) reports. We highlight the uses directors made of statistics and the aspects of statistics that they found particularly useful. The study's results are intended to provide library administrators with insights into ways that library statistics are used in the managerial process as well as to provide national statistical program administrators with information on the characteristics and use patterns of their products.",2001

"Martin, Jason",Workplace Engagement of Librarians and Library Staff,JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION,Workplace engagement; libraries; academic libraries; public libraries; school libraries; special libraries; library workplace,"Very little has been written about engagement in the library workplace. Engagement and burnout are two poles on the workplace behavior spectrum. Burnout can be defined as exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced efficacy in daily work. Engagement can be defined as the opposite of burnout: energy, involvement, and high efficacy. Actively engaged employees are more satisfied in their jobs, and they are more likely to innovate and move into leadership positions. This study sought to understand the level of engagement of librarians and library staff. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) uses 17 questions to determine an individual?s engagement in their work by measuring the three factors of vigor, dedication, and absorption. The scores (on a 0?6 scale) of participants (n?=?1100) for engagement was 4.25; vigor 4.15; dedication 4.52; and absorption 4.11. All of these scores are within the ?average? range. Analysis found differences in levels of engagement by type of library (academic, public, special, and school) and work performed (administrative responsibility and patron interaction), but the differences were small. Open-ended responses revealed the main influences on participant engagement were workload, work fit, and work expectations; recognition; culture and environment; leadership; health; and meaning.",2020

Examination of user-generated metadata. can reveal new approaches to information architecture. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review into behaviors of virtual communities; surveying public library readers regarding search behavior characteristics - the survey included a sample tagging exercise to determine whether public library communities could create meaningful metadata for retrieval purposes. Findings - The use of relevance as an indicator of tag quality is flawed: in a survey, public library readers tagged the novel The Da Vinci Code. The resulting collection of tags provided a richer description of the book than did the social book-related web site www.librarything.com. Tag collections can be broken down into different categories, each reflecting a different facet of the novel: character, plot, subject/topic, setting, and genre. Faceted structure to tags enables users to choose the context of the tag to the novel. Research limitations/implications - This research is relevant in the world of social networking sites, online communities, or any other such system where users generate descriptive metadata. Examination of such metadata can reveal facets, which can guide the architect/librarian in the design of a versatile architecture. Originality/value - This research resulted in a manifold design for a public-library-based online community that allowed for the full expression of users' information needs. This research introduces a faceted structure to current approaches for user-generated metadata, adding versatility to search terms.",2007

The aim of this paper is to create a survey to look for ways to improve the statewide service and improve the experience of chat librarians (as well as patrons). Design/methodology/approach - The authors surveyed L-net librarians to learn their thoughts and satisfaction with answering L-net chat questions. They collected anonymous survey data via PSU's web survey software (Qualtrics). The survey instrument was a mixture of qualitative and quantitative questions. The survey consisted of 29 questions. Findings - While the literature has many articles regarding patron satisfaction with chat reference, there is a dearth of articles regarding librarian satisfaction with chat. It was found that nearly a quarter of librarians said they did not answering chat questions on L-net. A total of 76 percent indicated they had received written abuse. Swearing was the number one complaint at 28 percent, followed by sexual comments and rude remarks, which tied at 17 percent.

Most public computers are not well prepared to cope with worms, Trojans and other malware. There are remedies for a lot of the malware, but as in an arms race it is a matter of catching up with the latest weapon to be presented. Practical implications - Since public computers are so vulnerable to attack, library IT must be constantly vigilant for the menaces that are present. The paper shows how computers can be protected. Originality/value - If this can help save one computer's workload by making people aware of the dangers involved, the information is well worthwhile.",2011

Most of the resources currently available to libraries hoping to get started take a corporate approach particularly as it impacts financial success. The bottom line is that all of us are in the customer experience business, whether we know it or not. It goes to the heart of everything we do - how staff interact with the public and each other, the value libraries provide to a community, even the cleanliness of the restrooms. Additionally, many of those companies that library users experience in their daily lives - health care, insurance, retail - have already jumped on the customer experience bandwagon, overall raising the public's expectation of what they should experience in libraries.

Elena; Caspe, Margaret; Simpson, Christina",Engaging Families in Public Libraries,PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY,Early literacy; family engagement; leadership; library survey; parents,"Public libraries today are undergoing significant transformations as well as interacting with patrons in new and different ways (Knight Foundation 2017). Part of this transformation is the way libraries are engaging entire families. Libraries are playing a stronger role than ever before in supporting families to promote children's early literacy and reading skills (Celano and Neuman 2015; Nagle et al. 2016; Neuman and Celano 2010), stimulating adult learning (Boden and Tashijan 2015), creating initiatives to improve family health (Morgan et al. 2016), providing services to families with extreme challenges such as those experiencing poverty, homelessness, food insecurity, and incarceration (Holt and Holt 2010; Terille 2016), as well as becoming spaces for families, especially those who are recent immigrants, to build new relationships and social networks (Khoir et al. 2017; Varheim 2014). Despite these efforts, few studies have specifically sought to understand the organizational dimensions that support family engagement within a library system and the potential that these efforts have in promoting children's learning not only in the early years, but also into and throughout middle childhood and adolescence.

Academic Libraries, while showing a growth of 13% over inflation for the period, far underperformed the growth of the other public institutions in the study. Academic Libraries lost nearly 25% of their share of higher education total spending, suggesting a shift in higher education priorities. Academic and Public Libraries are shown to have very different investment and spending priorities with Academic Libraries as a group reducing staff and investing in their collections, while Public Libraries have expanded their staff and services significantly, but not collections.

It presents an overview of two systems, the Performance Metrics (PMs) and the Common Impact Measurement System (CIMS). By providing a standard set of definitions and methods for use across countries, these systems enable grantees to collect data that can be compared and aggregated for the purpose of collective learning, improvement, accountability, and advocacy. Design/methodology/approach - The PMs offer a standard methodology to collect library project performance management data, whereas the CIMS is a standard survey of public library users. The paper describes how the PM and CIMS data are being visualized and used, with examples of findings and lessons learned. Findings - The paper cites examples of the type of PM and CIMS data available, with a focus on employment, gender, and case studies from Botswana and Indonesia. These highlights illustrate how libraries' user demographics differ from other types of public internet access venues and how libraries can contribute to strong employment and growth. Research limitations/implications - The measurement systems rely on different partners collecting data for the same metrics across different countries; while each grantee adheres to a standard methodology, small procedural, and methodological differences are inevitable. Future research could focus on conducting similar studies elsewhere, outside the cohort of countries in the GL portfolio of grants. Practical implications - The paper offers insights and lessons for library agencies or institutions interested in implementing a common measurement system. Recognizing that few library projects have the resources to track a comprehensive set of indicators, a case study is presented about how smaller initiatives can adapt these systems to their needs. Social implications - The indicators described in this paper enable public libraries to shift their focus from services provided to the outcomes they help individuals and communities realize, potentially increasing the potency of their programming and advocacy. Originality/value - Common measurement systems are not new, but their application in the public library field is novel, as is the Data Atlas, a platform grantees use to compare results across metrics, track progress, and conduct advocacy.",2015

"Bertot, John Carlo",Public Access Technologies in Public Libraries: Effects and Implications,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES,,"Public libraries were early adopters of Internet-based technologies and have provided public access to the Internet and computers since the early 1990s. The landscape of public-access Internet and computing was substantially different in the 1990s as the World Wide Web was only in its initial development. At that time, public libraries essentially experimented with public-access Internet and computer services, largely absorbing this service into existing service and resource provision without substantial consideration of the management, facilities, staffing, and other implications of public-access technology (PAT) services and resources. This article explores the implications for public libraries of the provision of PAT and seeks to look further to review issues and practices associated with PAT provision resources. While much research focuses on the amount of public access that public libraries provide, little offers a view of the effect of public access on libraries. This article provides insights into some of the costs, issues, and challenges associated with public access and concludes with recommendations that require continued exploration.",2009

The implementation of such a system, Evergreen, was examined in order to ascertain whether it facilitated detection and use of library collections in Indiana public libraries. Three hundred forty-nine participants recruited from nine public libraries completed user surveys. Additionally, library server data about interlibrary loan (ILL) statistics were collected from participating libraries on a monthly basis. The self-reported user survey included questions about patron history at local public libraries. use of the previous Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs), and use of the Evergreen OPAC for finding and accessing multiple library collections since library users could directly request interlibrary loans via the Evergreen OPAC. The findings indicate that the implementation of the Indiana Evergreen system received moderately positive ratings from the participants; the positive evaluation was primarily related to the use of the ILL function. The ILL service satisfied the participants' needs and motivated them to use the Evergreen OPAC. Benefits for Evergreen users were confirmed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2012

However, users may have different perceptions of how titles are to be grouped in genres or categories. Public library collections will be more accessible when the way their collection is organized matches these users' perceptions. The authors show how user perceptions can be derived from library loan transaction data. To overcome the particular methodological issues in using such data, a method of ultrametric trees and latent class analysis is developed to determine segments of users and how they categorize the collection. Results show clear user categorizations that in particular respects differ from conventional public library categorizations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2005

In addition to exploring gender-related variance in the reasons for which teenagers use public libraries, the survey investigated how frequently the respondents needed information relating to twelve major topic areas and how useful they considered public libraries in helping them to find information relating to these topics. For the most part, the results indicated no significant gender difference in the respondents' reasons for using libraries or in their frequency of information needs. The only major gender difference was the girls' tendency to rate libraries as more useful in helping them to meet their personal information needs, making public libraries female-friendly spaces for adolcscent girls.

Insights, challenges, successes, projects as well as recommendations will be shared. Commonalities across libraries 3D printing technologies and maker space learning areas will also explored. Design/methodology/approach - This paper delves into six case studies of librarians that have implemented 3D printers and/or maker spaces in their libraries. The case studies focus on libraries at three different levels: school, public, and higher education with two case studies from each type. The author of this paper will describe the cases, projects, challenges, successes, along with other aspects of 3D printer, and maker space integration. Findings - 3D printing and maker spaces, while very popular in the field of librarianship can be incredibly exciting to implement but they come with challenges and successes just like any type of new technology. Librarians have to be fearless in implementing this technology, willing to learn on their feet, and be excited to explore. Originality/value - At this time most publications on 3D printing are held in the realm of popular publications (blogs, magazines, zines, etc.). Very little has been written on a wider range of case studies where 3D printers and maker spaces have been integrated into libraries of various types.

"Martin, Lisa; Martin, Will",Modifying an information literacy game for outreach events,REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW,Marketing; Academic libraries; Outreach; Games; Public services in libraries,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss how to use a web-based library game as an outreach tool at events. Games in higher education are a trend that libraries have used for information literacy but less frequently for outreach. Although there are relatively few examples of the use of games in academic library outreach events, games have the potential to be excellent outreach tools by engaging students and presenting them with the opportunity to change their perceptions of the library. Design/methodology/approach - The University of North Dakota (UND) Libraries successfully connected with students at an outreach event by using a modified version of the Information Literacy Game originally developed by the University of North Carolina Greensboro (UNCG). UND Librarians created specific technical modifications and an event workflow, highlighted here, that other academic libraries can adapt for use at outreach events to attract both students who are and those who are not typically users of the library. Findings - The information literacy game, with some specific technical changes, is customizable in relatively inexpensive ways that allow librarians from institutions of all sizes to engage students with a game at outreach events. Originality/value - Games, especially Web-based games, have not previously been used in outreach events. The literature on the use of games in information literacy sessions but outreach is an even more logical fit for gaming. This paper presents a practical, value-oriented method for academic libraries to modify an information literacy game for use in outreach.",2015

This column argues that academic library users should not be called customers for a variety of reasons. Primarily, the goals of public and academic libraries differ. Public libraries seek to discover their users' wants and meet them. Academic libraries, in contrast, aim to teach and support their users' educational growth. Calling an academic library patron a customer implies that individual wants can take precedence over educational needs and that students should have influence over classroom instruction and curricular content. Steven Bell and I agree on the importance of customer service, but I believe that it is defined differently in public and academic libraries.",2020

Using a web-based survey, 171 employees of public libraries reported their level of burnout (emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy; Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey) and potential predictors, including levels of autonomy, co-worker support, work pressure, technology attitudes, and recovery experiences. A subset of 70 completed the burnout measures twice, allowing for predictions of change over time. Most predictors were correlated with burnout cross-sectionally, except for technology attitudes. Emotional exhaustion was positively associated with work pressure, and negatively associated with autonomy, role clarity, coworker support, and recovery experiences of relaxation, mastery, and control.

Although there is a significant body of literature on makerspaces in libraries, this study is one of the first ones that provides a comparison of library makerspace organization and operation by library type. Data was collected using paper and online surveys from 158 librarians. Supporting learning was the most frequently identified motivation for establishing a makerspace by all three categories of librarians. While makerspaces in academic libraries were mostly operated by library staff, school libraries more evenly relied on teaching staff, volunteers, library staff members, and paid instructors to operate their makerspaces. Makerspaces in public and academic libraries were funded mostly from the libraries' budget, while school libraries were funded more by other units on the campus and institutional or individual investments. The most frequently selected technologies were 3D printing and modeling technologies, and makerspaces in academic libraries were better equipped than makerspaces in the other two types of libraries. Group study rooms and learning commons centers were the most frequently occurring physical spaces in academic and public library makerspaces. School library makerspaces differentiated themselves by offering wooden crafts centers more often than other library makerspaces. While participants selecting budget limitation and inadequate equipment as barriers to implementing makerspaces was not surprising, public and academic librarians also often cited the lack of professional instructors. Based on the findings, several suggestions were offered to the practice of planning and operating a makerspace in libraries such as bringing together internal and external funding to support makerspaces, consolidating the required physical space of makerspaces and the existing space arrangement of libraries, and developing additional training programs to address the problem of a lack of professional instructors.",2020

There is convincing evidence that, in an era of decreasing state support for public higher education, public universities have begun to resemble private universities, particularly in their sources of revenue. A number of indicators demonstrate that public universities, like private universities, are increasingly dependent on tuition and fees, federal grants and contracts, private gifts, and revenues from auxiliary services. How has this shift in revenue sources affected public university research libraries? Are public university research libraries beginning to resemble private university research libraries in how they are funded as well?

"Jaeger, Paul T.; Fleischmann, Kenneth R.","Public libraries, values, trust, and e-government",INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES,,"As public libraries are becoming e-government access points relied on by both patrons and government agencies, it is important for libraries to consider the implications of these roles. While providing e-government access serves to reinforce the tremendously important role of public libraries in the United States social infrastructure, it also creates new demands on libraries and opens up significant new opportunities. Drawing upon several different strands of research, this paper examines the nexus of public libraries, values, trust, and e-government, focusing on the ways in which the values of librarianship and the trust that communities place in their public libraries reinforce the role of public libraries in the provision of e-government. The unique values embraced by public libraries have not only shaped the missions of libraries, they have influenced popular opinion surrounding public libraries and fostered the confidence that communities place in them as a source of trusted information and assistance in finding information. As public libraries have embraced the provision of Internet access, these values and trust have become intertwined with their new social role as a public access point for e-government both in normal information activities and in the most extreme circumstances. This paper explores the intersections of these issues and the relation of the vital e-government role of public libraries to library funding, public policy, library and information science education, and research initiatives.",2007

Content analysis is applied to texts gleaned from structured questions posed to members of the focus groups. The questions probed the specific knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) considered by members of the focus groups as critical to the successful employment and performance of individuals aiming to work in urban or complex library settings. Results of the focus groups yielded insights of potential value for new professionals, practitioners, and LIS educators in the United States.

Design/methodology/approach - Through literature searches, case studies analysis, and individual phone and e-mail interviews, the author identified ways that public libraries can use their buildings to demonstrate green technologies and practices and show their patrons how to apply them at home, at work, and in the community. Findings - Education is a component of LEED certification. Many LEED certified libraries publicize a list of the green technologies used in their building projects. Some sponsor programs related to the green building and include permanent displays in the library to explain how the technology works. The Fayetteville Public Library went beyond these basic techniques to not only improve the sustainability of their operations but also become a community test bed for a renewable energy project.

Direct observations of their use of computers and data gathered from brief interviews with them were recorded using personal digital assistants (PDAs). Findings suggest that (1) the largest proportion of children's use of computers is for access to games, (2) use of computers for communication purposes (e.g., chat, e-mail, and word processing) is minimal, and (3) repeat use of the computers varies by branch. Grade level analysis reveals that middle school students access games less than elementary students do at two branches and that middle school students use the computers more than elementary students do for communication purposes. Overall, girls and boys use games, chat, and e-mail in comparable proportions. In other categories of use, there are gender differences but no consistent pattern emerges across branches. This investigation provides a first view of children's unmediated use of technology in the public library, their reasons for using library computers, and provides baseline data for assessing the outcomes of technology programs and services developed by the library to serve the needs of this user group.

Design/methodology/approach - The research, conducted through questionnaires, focuses on fifth-grade students in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area because state-mandated test results for core subjects are available at the state Department of Education web site. Thus, it allows the researchers to collect data on both technology accessibility and academic achievement. Findings - The findings show that the digital divide still exists, cutting through various socioeconomic factors, and that the relationship between technology accessibility and academic achievement may also exist, although it is very much complicated by other compounding factors, such as the subjects of learning, the uses of technology, and socioeconomic conditions. It is hoped that the findings of this research can help policy makers, school administrators and teachers better understand the issues of digital divide and the consequences of technology use in schools and beyond.

Given the prevalence of recommender systems on the wider web, especially in e-commerce environments, this paper aims to review current research in this area that is of particular relevance to the library community. It attempts to gauge the uptake of recommender systems in exiting OPAC services, and identify issues that might be responsible for inhibiting wider uptake. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on an extensive literature review, as well as original research comparing the functionality of 211 public and 118 university library OPACs in the UK. Examining current recommender systems research, it outlines the most significant recommendation models and reviews research in two key areas of recommender systems design: data acquisition, and the explanation of recommendations. It discusses three existing library recommendation systems: BibTip, LibraryThing for Libraries and the in-house system at the University of Huddersfield. Findings - The authors' analysis indicates that the incorporation of recommender systems into library services is extremely low, with only 2 per cent of public libraries and 11 per cent of university libraries in the UK offering the feature. While system limitations and budget constraints are perhaps partly to blame, it is suggested that library professionals have perhaps yet to be persuaded that the value of recommendations to library users is great enough to warrant their inclusion becoming a priority.

Over the last 7 years, state agencies have increasingly disseminated information in digital formats via the Internet, posing challenges for the State Library to collect, manage, and preserve state publications for public access. In order to address these challenges, the State Library initiated a multiyear research project to develop a plan for managing digital state publications for permanent public access. The first year of the project was devoted to gaining knowledge of current publishing practices by surveying state agency staff and reviewing a selection of state agency publications. The article discusses the results of this research, using North Carolina as an example to illustrate many of the challenges of providing permanent public access to digital information, including rapidly changing Web sites, technological obsolescence, lack of standards for preservation and access, complex political considerations, and difficulty obtaining sufficient funding.

Design/methodology/approach - Describes the genesis and current development projects of NorthStarNet, an online community information network comprised of 40 + public library community sites in the Chicago suburbs. Findings - Needs of communities and libraries regarding web hosting and online community information have changed greatly since the launch of NorthStarNet launched in 1995. Original community sites were so individual that content and usability issues were taking prominence. Development of a unique application allows for the creation and maintenance of sites with graphic and technical sophistication by library staff and community members with limited technical expertise. The new application also supports the aggregation of the community information from the 40+ individual sites to make it globally searchable. Originality/value - This paper describes a service that has successfully positioned libraries as an important resource and technology leader in their communities. Included are descriptions of applications that make the online resource user-friendly to those that create and maintain, as well as use the site.",2006

The constant comparison method and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. A model emerged which describes the effects of social, cognitive, and affective influences on personal preservation decisions as well as the effects of fading cognitive associations and technological advances, combined with information escalation over time. Because the preservation of personal digital information involves personal, social, and technological interactions, the integration of these factors is necessary for a viable solution to the digital preservation problem.",2011
"Hemmeter, Jeffrey A.",Household use of public libraries and large bookstores,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"This article examines competition between large, inexpensive bookstores and public libraries. Using the National Household Education Survey and logit and multinomial logit estimation procedures, the study finds that large bookstores reduce the probability of household library use for some, but not all, uses of the library. Children's programming is found to be mostly immune to competition whereas job-related and informational uses of the library are reduced. The measure of crowding out is largely from diminished library use by middle-income households. Because this group traditionally uses the library most frequently, the impact of these bookstores could potentially alter the funding and services libraries traditionally offer, changing their redistributional capabilities.

Design/methodology - A quantitative design was implemented with a self-administered survey that was placed online. Findings - Public youth services librarians in the USA believe it is important to collaborate with school librarians. However, they are not frequently using collaborative resource sharing strategies. Public youth services librarians that have more experience, understand trends and issues in school libraries and feel they have knowledge of collaborative strategies are more likely to engage in collaborative resource sharing. Research limitations - The study was limited to 265 public librarians serving youth in the USA. This study does not present the perspectives of school libraries. Social implications - CCD and ILL between public and school libraries are overlooked practices for building relationships between public and school librarians that should be explored. Presenting the benefits of these strategies during training programs may increase the resources that youth can access, thus having an overall impact on the quality of life in communities. Collaborating will also help communities understand the value of libraries as institutions for promoting lifelong learning. Originality/value - The results provide evidence that public youth service librarians in the USA believe in the importance of collaborative relationships with school librarians. However, they do not frequently use ILL or engage in CCD behaviors with school librarians. Using ILL and CCD are two strategies that may be used to build stronger relationships.",2014
"Moorefield-Lang, Heather Michele",User agreements and makerspaces: a content analysis,NEW LIBRARY WORLD,Public libraries; Academic libraries; 3D printing; Liability forms; Makerspace; User agreements,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the user agreements of makerspaces in public and academic libraries. User agreements, also known as maker agreements, user forms and liability forms, can be very important documents between library patrons, staff and faculty. User agreements are similar to the earlier creation of acceptable use policies for technology use in libraries. The author of this study will delve into the user agreements created for public and academic libraries across the USA. Design/methodology/approach - The researcher used content analysis to investigate 24 different user agreements written for public and academic library makerspaces. NVivo qualitative data analysis software was integrated into this research to aid in the breakdown of commonalities across terms, themes and purpose within the user agreements. Findings - Although makerspaces are a very exciting topic in the field of library science at this time, the implementation of a maker learning space is still new to many libraries. Creating a user agreement for a makerspace is newer still. Most user agreements in this study were six months to a year old. Some consistencies found across makerspace user agreements include liability waivers, permissions for minors, safety, copyright and technology replacement costs. Originality/value - At this time, most publications on makerspaces are held in the realm of popular publications (blogs, magazines, zines, etc.). The body of peer-reviewed and scholarly research on makerspaces is growing.

First, libraries have been inextricably tied to educational institutions in the modern era. Second, libraries developed within democratic societies and took on aspects of the public sphere (as did classrooms), even while public spheres were being transformed in the macro sense. Third, these two contextual conditions predominated for half of our period but led to a fundamental conservative rethinking of civil society institutions like schools and libraries: neoliberalism as a loose set of economic and market principles projected into schools, universities, and libraries, resulting in economic and political inequalities and an undermining of democratic and civil society institutions. These three contexts do not explain everything about libraries during LQ's run of publication, but they situate a great deal of that history.",2020

The case study research design included document review of the library's wayfinding information system; unobtrusive observation of library user wayfinding behavior; intensive interviews with library users to discuss their views on wayfinding in the library; and an expert review with library staff and a library wayfinding and signage expert to validate research findings. Overall, the study found library users' wayfinding behavior to be generally inconsistent over time, but that there are users who stick to predominant segments (those segments used heavily to connect two particular nodes, or stops). Those segments tend to be the straightest or most direct segments connecting two given nodes. Also, users appear to employ Passini's wayfinding styles more often than his wayfinding strategies, but additional research is needed that delves more deeply into these cognitive processes.

This research extends existing literature by combining household-level data (public library checkout counts, residential property tax assessment values, student enrollment rosters, and distance to public library measures) to conduct a panel analysis of public library use across the public school calendar. The empirical analyses find that public- school breaks generally impact library use for households with children in public school, but not for households without children in public school or for the lowest socioeconomic status households with children in public school. Distance to library is found to be negatively correlated with public library use for all households, but differentially and dependent on households' socioeconomic status and structure.

Infomediaries help PAC users and other members of the community meet their information needs through formal or informal training, support and service activities that result in better direct or indirect use of ICT resources. Infomediaries help foster digital inclusion and bridge gaps such as illiteracy, limited physical access to a venue, insufficient technology-operation skills, and income constraints. We discuss findings of an in-depth study of PAC in Colombia, South America, conducted by University of Washington researchers and local partners. Combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, we analyze the role of infomediaries in three types of PAC venues: libraries, telecenters and cybercafe's. Infomediaries in PAC venues contribute to human development by enabling easier access to (1) information on education, health, government services and other social needs in the community (Social Impact); (2) information about jobs, employment, business opportunities, and agricultural resources (Economic Impact); and (3) information and communication resources to strengthen personal relationships and sense of belonging to a local and global community (Community Impact).

Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was distributed to SBDC offices in the mountain west region of the USA to discover if and how they are working with local public and academic libraries and librarians to provide information and services to entrepreneurs. Findings - Surveys were sent to 72 SBDCs with 31 responding (43 per cent). A total of 48 per cent indicated collaborating with public libraries and 36 per cent work with academic libraries. Resources and services provided by librarians and libraries are consistent with the reporting in case study literature. Responses to successes and issues with these arrangements indicate areas for improvement and consideration in collaborations. Research limitations/implications - This research was limited to findings from SBDC offices in the mountain west region. A national survey of efforts might provide more comprehensive results. Future research into whether these partnerships are worthwhile and benefit entrepreneurs and the local economy would be beneficial. Practical implications - The findings indicate areas in which improvements in collaborations could be made in communication and expectations. Social implications - This research might inform future collaborations as communities explore economic development and support of local entrepreneurs. Originality/value - This research provides the unique perspective of non-librarians about these working relationships with librarians. The findings may be useful to improving existing collaborations and in consideration of future partnerships.,2015

Design/methodology/approach - Literature review and commentary on this topic that has been addressed by professionals, researchers and practitioners. Findings - Libraries have learned from business the importance of using not only the business practice of using a vigorous level of data-driven decision-making, but data-driven reporting as well to a public that expects a higher level of scrutiny, clarity and precision. Paired with evidence from those who have benefitted from the library's programs and services most visibly, this combination of data and human-driven anecdotes can serve as the optimum marriage of business and service-based confirmation of library success. Originality/value - The value in exploring this topic is to make the distinction between libraries whose supporters expect it to be formally managed like a business as opposed to those who suggest that business practices be used in library operations to ensure its mission as a service-based entity is maintained.",2017
"Houston, George W.",Tiberius and the libraries: Public book collections and library buildings in the early Roman empire,LIBRARIES & THE CULTURAL RECORD,,"The principate of the emperor Tiberius was a surprisingly interesting period in Roman library history. Devoted to books and scholarship himself, Tiberius built what must have been a very large new library, but he also confirmed the Augustan principle of constructing numerous separate structures rather than one comprehensive library. He invented the position of library commissioner, to which he appointed a scholarly advisor, not an administrator. He gave texts of three Greek authors to the libraries. This implies that those works had not previously been in the collection and so gives its valuable insight into the contents of the Augustan libraries.",2008

"Park, Sung Jae",Measuring public library accessibility: A case study using GIS,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"Physical accessibility is considered a fundamental measure of freedom to attend activities. Although several accessibility analyses have been conducted of public libraries, these studies tend to measure the distance from the users' homes to the library using straight lines. This generally serves as a poor measurement of actual travel distances. In order to provide more realistic analysis, and measure patterns of library access more accurately, this study employed geographic information systems (GIS), including descriptive and statistical analyses, and a road network-based distance measure. One finding from the GIS analyses was that distance was a determining factor for library use. Specifically, the evidence shows that distance affected a considerable number of registered users who lived within the areas that were defined through Thiessen polygons. Another finding was that there was a difference in the travel distance between ethnic groups: Caucasians went further to access public libraries than other ethnic groups. Finally, in terms of the relationship between distance and demographic data, household characteristics relative to children and education level were significantly related to the travel distance of users. To improve the accessibility of public libraries, this study recommends librarians define service areas for libraries, develop library programs and services for susceptible user groups, and evaluate user groups' needs.

The topic is complex due to the arbitrary assignment of a number of kilobytes per second (kbps) used to define bandwidth. Such arbitrary definitions to describe bandwidth sufficiency and quality are not useful. Public libraries are indeed connected to the Internet and do provide public-access services and resources. It is, however, time to move beyond connectivity type and speed questions and consider issues of bandwidth sufficiency, quality, and the range of networked services that should be available to the public from public libraries. A secondary but important issue is the extent to which libraries, particularly in rural areas, have access to broadband telecommunications services.",2007

"Real, Brian; Bertot, John Carlo; Jaeger, Paul T.",Rural Public Libraries and Digital Inclusion: Issues and Challenges,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES,,"Rural public libraries have been relatively understudied when compared to public libraries as a whole. Data are available to show that rural libraries lag behind their urban and suburban counterparts in technology service offerings, but the full meaning and effect of such disparities is unclear. The authors combine data from the Public Library Technology and Access Study with data from smaller studies to provide greater insight to these issues. By filtering these data through the digital inclusion framework, it becomes clear that disparities between rural and nonrural libraries are not merely a problem of weaker technological infrastructure. Instead, rural libraries cannot reach their full customer service potential because of lower staffing (but not lower staff dedication) and funding mechanisms that rely primarily on local monies. The authors suggest possible solutions to these disparities while also discussing the barriers that must be overcome before such solutions can be implemented.",2014
"Weldon, S",Collaboration and marketing ensure public and medical library viability,LIBRARY TRENDS,,"THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION over the past twenty years has inspired many to usurp the job of the librarian. Health professionals are writing articles about the provision of health information for their patients. Newspaper and magazine articles tout the importance of health information companies as the means through which the public can pay for access to health information. Hospital libraries are closing at a rapid rate throughout the United States, with hospital administrators citing lack of funding as the reason and viewing the medical library as a drain on the hospital bottom line. Collaboration and marketing are two elements that ensure the library remains viable in the eyes of health professionals, hospital administrators, and the public.

By focusing narrowly on the issue of whether Internet access in libraries constitutes a public forum, and determining that it does not, the U.S. Supreme Court not only misses an opportunity to refine the concept of the public forum in modern-day terms but also somehow implies that public library activities are different from other speech activities and are subject to the managerial authority of the government. This article makes the argument that a redefinition of the public forum doctrine would bring tinder its ambit the public library, to join the traditional public forums such as streets, sidewalks, and parks-a departure from the current designation of the public library as a limited public forum.

Methods - Using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework as a theoretical lens, the study used semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to investigate the impact of PAV ICTs in 4 study sites, resulting in data from a total of 39 interviews and 4 focus groups. Results - The results of the study show that PAV ICTs had a positive impact on users in the areas of education and economic benefits. Within educational and economic impacts, social benefits were also found, pertaining to the use of social media and the Internet for formal and informal communication. The study also revealed a slight difference between school going users and non-school going elderly users where the use and acquisition of computer skills was concerned. Elderly non-school going users tended to rely on venue staff for skills more than the younger school going users. Conclusion - The study recommends that PAV facilities should be improved in terms of skills offered and resources availed so as to appeal to both the younger school going generation and the older non-school going users. It is also recommended that education on ICT be improved to help curb rising unemployment in Botswana; such skills would enhance the income generation skills of the unemployed users as well as school leavers.",2015

In this changing landscape of globally and rapidly evolving information technologies and upcoming social media with an abundance of readily and easily available information and data. This buffet is delivered through increasingly developed broad band networks, soon via 5G, so with the intense fight for attention by all information providers and mediators, it is no wonder that many libraries have engaged in change processes that are profoundly transforming library services, programs, organization, spatial layout, and the job content of library staff. A general movement away from libraries as transactional, book-and-collection focused institutions towards relational user and community focused organizations has been evident in this period. Not all libraries have taken a proactive stance to the change; a more reactive and reluctant approach to the societal and technological changes is not entirely uncommon, still, no library has been unaffected by the development. And the societal changes are continuing relentlessly as are the persistent speculations in and outside the library sector about the future of libraries. These societal changes and the transformation in library practices raise the question whether these changes are duly reflected in the library and information science education.

"Lawrence, E. E.",On the problem of oppressive tastes in the public library,JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION,Readers' advisory; Diversity; Library ethics; Social justiced; Taste; Feminist aesthetics; Democracy,"Purpose Contemporary adult readers' advisory aims to adhere to (what I term) a pure preference satisfaction model in which librarians provide nonjudgmental book recommendations that satisfy their patrons' aesthetic tastes rather than improve upon them. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether readers' advisors really ought to treat all such tastes as essentially benign, even when doing so may conflict with core commitments to diversity and social responsibility. Design/methodology/approach This paper utilizes a thought experiment to interrogate our intuitions regarding the practice of recommending recreational materials featuring marginalized protagonists. The author also draws on theoretical insights from feminist aesthetician A.W. Eaton's innovative work on taste in bodies to formulate argumentation addressing the ethical dilemma presented here. Findings Our reading tastes can, in fact, be oppressive, working to maintain unjust power relations that are often thought to be the product merely of bad beliefs. On the view advanced here, oppressive tastes function as real obstacles to collective self-governance because they systematically distort our judgments of the credibility, empathic accessibility, and fundamental worth of our fellow democratic citizens. Librarians' obligation to protect and promote democracy, therefore, provides practitioners with a crucial justification for recommending diverse books to all readers, even (and perhaps especially) those who actively disprefer them. Originality/value The paper illustrates how contemporary work in analytic (and specifically feminist) aesthetics can furnish LIS scholars with the intellectual resources to resolve political problems in the library. The author's analysis also lays the groundwork for further consideration of alternative ideals for readers' advisory that will capitalize on the service's educative and emancipatory potential.",2020

Many libraries have indeed developed programming for women during National Women's History Month, but many more have planned women's programming as part of their regular offering of programs. Women's programming has been strengthened by a greater visibility of the diverse needs and interests of women, funding for programs for women, and greatly expanded publishing activity that continually provides new titles on women's issues for public library collections. Women themselves have been a catalyst for programming as they have been avid users of public libraries and often the primary audience for library programs.

The corporate promotion model requires moving into a position with increased responsibilities and is often the only model in public libraries. The academic promotion model also offers the possibility of promotion for increased performance of the same duties, usually according to more formal rules. A blocked path for promotion can lead to leaving the library for opportunities elsewhere or create morale problems.

The hypotheses are: libraries with larger budgets and larger per capita income are more likely to have accessible websites. Of the 78 public library systems home pages examined, only 21 were found to be without accessibility errors. These findings indicate that 73% of the home pages had at least one major accessibility error based on Section 508 criteria. Additional findings indicate that accessibility performance is related to library income levels and income per service population.

From a list of current public library directors and managers, 15 participants completed a 30-minute phone interview that followed a semi-structured guide. By analyzing the intersection of complexity of approach with complexity of context, eight leadership approaches were uncovered through coding. Results suggest that most participants engaged with most of the leadership approaches at some point. In addition, most of these approaches were seen as successful and innovative-though in different ways. Findings suggest that traditional hardline distinctions between leadership and management-or innovative and non-innovative-are no longer useful. This study is an important contribution to the study of public library leadership, as it applies theories of complexity to both approach and context.",2020

A phenomenological study,REFERENCE & USER SERVICES QUARTERLY,,"This article presents the results of a study in which seventeen college students who use public libraries for their college assignments were interviewed about their reasons for using public libraries rather than academic libraries. Five factors emerged from the students' responses: personal convenience, materials, ease of use and familiarity, staff, and subjective appeal. Many of the students interviewed mentioned children, jobs, and other responsibilities, indicating that students who use public libraries might tend to be nontraditional students. Library anxiety also was identified as a possible contributing factor to students' choice of library. The implications of this study for further research in the area are discussed.",2004

Some scholars criticize these documents, arguing that they are unrealistic and do not offer meaningful support to libraries. While scholars question the value of ALA policies, it is unclear whether practicing librarians have similar concerns about the Library Bill of Rights (LBR) and related guidelines. This article describes a study of public libraries and their interpretation of the LBR in their daily practice. To investigate the role played by ALA documents, 15 public library directors across one state were interviewed. In general, the library directors did not directly cite or quote from ALA documents, yet their stances echoed ALA guidance. In addition, library directors frequently discussed the significance of community in their interpretations and implementations of intellectual freedom.",2016

Design/methodology/approach The study is a content analysis of eight library websites to determine passive IL instruction and active literacy instruction. Findings Library web guides offer passive IL instruction by highlighting resources patrons may wish to access to resolve information inquiries. Further, the authors found that a little less than 50 per cent of library programming offers some IL instruction, the majority of which relates to helping patrons learn to use tools to create information products. Originality/value IL is the ability to recognize the need for information, to effectively find information to meet that need and to use information for some purpose or goal. Academic, school and public libraries believe that understanding and using information critically and effectively bring gains to an individual and to society. However, they diverge in how and why they engage in IL instruction. The authors' findings suggest that less than half of the libraries surveyed are providing active IL instruction, despite the recognition of the benefits IL provides.",2019

The global milieu of the New York World's Fair 1939-40 frames the historical events that stimulated each of the student's topics. To determine what each public library's collection held about the world, the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) section of geography and travel (classification number 910) was used. Cross-referencing each library's accession records for books added prior to 1945 against books recommended for all public libraries in the geography and travel (910) sections of standard professional guides like the ALA catalogs, the H.W. Wilson Company's Standard Catalog for Public Libraries, and other ALA publications like the Guide to Reference Books shows what students using these five libraries would have found.

However, health-related information and services have a lower profile than other services due to a perceived lack of librarian expertise in searching and evaluating health resources. Although public library users are actively seeking health information, it has become critical for both public librarians and users to develop skills for using and evaluating Internet health resources. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify a set of useful criteria to evaluate online health web sites for both librarians and library users. From a comprehensive literature review, 33 criteria related to health website evaluation were identified. Using this set of criteria, South Korean public librarians and users were asked to rate the importance of each criterion in surveys. A strong consensus was found between the two groups. The top 10 most highly rated criteria from both groups were identified and compared. The results led to the development of an initial set of 12 evaluation criteria for health websites. It is expected that the final set of criteria will be used by public librarians to recommend the best health websites to their users. Although the study was conducted in South Korean public libraries, the findings are applicable in providing evaluation services of health websites to libraries worldwide.

This paper reviews the actions of the extreme right in imposing their political ideology on library acquisitions and services, and the reactions they provoked. Their intervention called into question the mission of public libraries, political autonomy, acquisitions policies and practices, and the role of the librarian. French librarians, the nation, and ultimately the international community were alerted to the National Front's subversion of libraries to a political agenda. These incidents triggered practical and philosophical responses as librarians developed strategies to combat political interference, confronted issues of censorship and the challenge of developing pluralistic collections, and asserted the librarian's role in safeguarding democratic principles. The response of library associations in France is also discussed.",2003

Data from a 1999 survey of Arizona public library service outlets do not support the role of metropolitan status in outreach provision but reaffirms the role of staffing. In this dataset, Arizona public library service outlets had ongoing outreach efforts, with schools and preschools being the most popular venue for providing those services. Analyzing outlets' provision of outreach as a function of staffing revealed that there is a positive relationship between the number of librarians on staff and the odds that a library would conduct outreach. While metropolitan libraries were also associated with an increase in the odds of conducting outreach and making school visits, this was assumed to be a spurious correlation due to the lack of significance in models accounting for staff and metropolitan status.

To better understand this problem, this study adopts a communication system approach. Using qualitative content analysis, this study examines data from three US public library systems. This study analyzes how private actors communicate with and through public library systems by parsing the signals into components: transmitter, receiver, medium, and message. The resulting signals form two dimensions: the Public Sphere dimension, where private actors govern, legitimate, and use the library, and the Private Sphere dimension, where private actors exchange personal services and exert economic power. A view of public and private signals in interaction reveals how public legitimacy is threatened and how public library systems can mitigate these threats.

Brief Description: Although NLM has always had collections and services relevant to public health, the US public health workforce made relatively little use of the library's information services and programs in the twentieth century. In the 1990s, intensified emphases on outreach to health professionals, building national information infrastructure, and promoting health data standards provided NLM with new opportunities to reach the public health community. A seminal conference cosponsored by NLM in 1995 produced an agenda for improving public health access to and use of advanced information technology and electronic information services. NLM actively pursued this agenda by developing new services and outreach programs and promoting public health informatics initiatives. Method: Historical analysis is presented.

This is especially true during a natural disaster or other crisis situation that might occur in a library. Media and public relations are often the last aspects of crisis management that libraries consider when they complete emergency preparations. When a disaster or crisis occurs, communication to the public and to media outlets is imperative to reduce rumors and misinformation. Immediate communication is also known to maintain a credible reputation for the organization that is proactive in communicating facts about the crisis (Claeys & Cauberghe, 2012). The literature provides excellent advice for communicating during a crisis. However, theory is frequently different than putting this theory into practice.

"Carlozzi, Michael",The Socioeconomic Profile of Well-Funded Public Libraries: A Regression Analysis,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,,"Objective - This study aimed to explore the well-established link between public library funding and activity, specifically to what extent socioeconomic factors could explain the correlation. Methods - State-level data from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners were analyzed for 280 public libraries using two linear regression models. These public libraries were matched with socioeconomic data for their communities. Results - Confirming prior research, a library's municipal funding correlated strongly with its direct circulation. In terms of library outputs, the municipal funding appeared to represent a library's staffing and number of annual visitations. For socioeconomic factors, the strongest predictor of a library's municipal appropriation was its number of educated residents. Other socioeconomic factors were far less important. Conclusion - Although education correlated strongly with library activity, variation within the data suggests that public libraries are idiosyncratic and that their funding is not dictated exclusively by the community's socioeconomic profile. Library administrators and advocates can examine what libraries of similar socioeconomic profiles do to receive additional municipal funding.",2018

BiblioTech capitalizes on technology to reach beyond the library walls and integrate the public library in facets of everyday life previously unavailable through paper and print. At its core, BiblioTech changes the traditional understanding of how libraries operate. BiblioTech's digital model prompts a paradigm shift and challenges the library to seek out new ways to serve otherwise disengaged patron populations. This article discusses the launch of BiblioTech-its impetus, mission, timeline, and challenges. The evolution of BiblioTech over its first four years of operation is presented, along with various community and intergovernmental partnerships that the library has forged in fulfillment of its mission. Finally, future opportunities and plans for development are also explored.",2017

"Black, Alistair",New Beauties: The Design of British Public Library Buildings in the 1960s,LIBRARY TRENDS,,"In 1960 the architectural correspondent of London's Times newspaper praised contemporary architects for having evolved what he called new beauties: attractive, modernist buildings created out of new techniques and approaches to style and structure. This study features a particular set of these new beauties: public library buildings of the 1960s, both large and small. In the 1960s, public library design finally broke free from its Victorian heritage. The new library buildings that appeared in this decade, clothed as they were in the architectural modernism of the time, reflected an age of optimism and intended modernization, when faith in the postwar welfare state was at its height, when hopes for technological and economic renewal were running high, and when the outlook of professional librarians was becoming increasingly progressive.",2011

The survey reveals some surprising disjunctures that run counter to trends in the academy. It also highlights the role publishers and bibliographers have played in establishing favored texts for a general readership and demonstrates that publishers of literary classics and bibliographies geared toward librarians have not always promoted the same texts as their academic counterparts. On the whole, it concludes, women writers fared quite well in the hands of publishers and public libraries promoting the classics at the same time that they suffered at the hands of major textbook publishers and scholarly editors intent on defining the canon.",2012

Brief Description: The National Library of Medicine-funded project Access to Electronic Health Information at the HSLS, University of Pittsburgh, provided Internet health information training to public libraries and librarians in sixteen counties in western Pennsylvania. Through this project, this academic medical center library identified the challenges for public librarians in providing health-related reference service, developed a training program to address those challenges, and evaluated the impact of this training on public librarians' ability to provide health information. Results/Outcome: The HSLS experience indicates academic medical center libraries can have a positive impact on their communities by providing health information instruction to public librarians. The success of this project-demonstrated by the number of participants, positive course evaluations, increased comfort level with health-related reference questions, and increased use of MEDLINEplus and other quality information resources-has been a catalyst for continuation of this programming, not only for public librarians but also for the public in general.

"VanScoy, Amy; Thomson, Leslie; Hartel, Jenna",Applying theory in practice: The serious leisure perspective and public library programming,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"Program planning in public libraries is generally guided by anecdotal best practices, facilitator interest, or perceived need, and not by theoretical frameworks, which can provide more systematic and evidence-based guidance and understanding. The Serious Leisure Perspective, a grounded theoretical framework imported to the information and library science field, offers clarity to researchers of leisure-related information activities. Here, its potential as a tool to guide librarians and other information professionals in the planning of leisure-related adult programming in public libraries is investigated. Online titles and descriptions of a two-week sample of adult, leisure-related public library programs from four North American, two Canadian and two American, public libraries were studied using directed content analysis, and a codebook was created for future research in this area. Application of the Serious Leisure Perspective to the sample reveals uneven distributions of public library programs across leisure forms and activity (sub-)types. The study demonstrates the potential of theoretical frameworks to identify gaps and opportunities in library practice. It also points to opportunities for developing new library programs, services, and resources that may appeal to currently untapped audiences.",2020

An ongoing challenge for the LIS community is to identify the key areas in which to increase professional knowledge and skills. The purpose of this study was to identify what working library staff considered valued competencies for youth services, reference services, director, and non-degreed library staff positions, as well as their preferred delivery format for CE. Open-ended survey activities were conducted via four research sessions, with a total of 57 library staff members participating in the study. The findings from the study suggest that the preferred CE delivery format is low-cost or no-cost, limited-time-commitment workshops with high interactivity. Valued competencies identified in the study indicated interdisciplinary trends of business management skills for library directors; technology skills and diversity/inclusion training for library staff and adult services/reference librarians; and knowledge around child and adolescent cognitive, behavioral, and literacy development for youth librarians.

In 1910 the Chicago Tribune favorably reported on a so-called Book Inferno in the library; a metaphorical pit where works of questionable merit were hidden from immature readers. Patrons, especially juveniles, needed to convince a librarian of their honorable intentions before being granted access to works in the Inferno. By 1936, the same institution issued a forceful Intellectual Freedom statement that affirmed the right, and the obligation, of the library to provide access to books on any subject of interest to its readers, including controversial works. An examination of the treatment accorded controversial works in the Chicago Public Library in the decades preceding the 1936 Intellectual Freedom statement reveals both continuity and change in attitudes towards censorship.",2014

"Donnelly, Francis P.",Regional variations in average distance to public libraries in the United States,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"There are substantive regional variations in public library accessibility in the United States, which is a concern considering the civic and educational roles that libraries play in communities. Average population-weighted distances and the total population living within one mile segments of the nearest public library were calculated at a regional level for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, and at a state level. The findings demonstrate significant regional variations in accessibility that have been persistent over time and cannot be explained by simple population distribution measures alone. Distances to the nearest public library are higher in the South compared to other regions, with statistically significant clusters of states with lower accessibility than average. The national average population-weighted distance to the nearest public library is 2.1 miles. While this supports the use of a two-mile buffer employed in many US studies to measure library service areas, the degree of variation that exists between regions and states suggests that local measures should be applied to local areas.

Engaging with marginalized communities is at the heart of ICT4D fieldwork. However, vulnerabilities of marginalized communities can prevent them from participating in fieldwork. The goal of this paper is to report best practices for engaging with marginalized communities. The findings are grounded in our fieldwork that consisted of ten three-hour sessions, each including focus groups, surveys, and hands-on exercises, with 152 participants earning less than USD 2 a day, in their native language at ten rural and urban public libraries in India. We conclude that a combination of proactive planning around the vulnerabilities of marginalized communities, constant reflective monitoring of the vulnerabilities and resulting challenges during fieldwork, and appropriate responsive action to address the challenges is one of the best ways of conducting fieldwork, since it helped us manage a majority of the challenges resulting from geographic, temporal, technological, financial, educational, psychological, informational, infrastructural, social, and cultural vulnerabilities of the participants. Our organic and structured guidance in the form of lessons learned can help library and information science researchers and practitioners to customize fieldwork around the vulnerabilities of marginalized communities.",2020

TWC can complement LIS research and practice that is increasingly participatory and community centric. The potentials and pitfalls for TWC are illustrated by ongoing research examining public library service to LGBTQIA+ communities for health information. The authors used TWC in a community forum between LGBTQIA+ community leaders and librarians/paraprofessionals in [name removed for blind review]. Per TWC conventions, participants engaged in day-long rotating cafe-style table conversations that encouraged new ideas and collective dialog. Discussion centered on two themes: barriers to health information faced by LGBTQIA+ communities and collective strategies for leaders and librarians/paraprofessionals to address them. Findings indicate that TWC can advance LIS research and practice in the following ways: refuting deficit frameworks, fostering information communities, and supporting social-justice-oriented praxis. Methodological shortcomings relate to the blind spots TWC affords to social inequality and power. The authors recommend that researchers and practitioners should incorporate intersectional and reflexive methods into TWC to address these shortcomings.",2020

Design/methodology/approach - Information was gathered using structured and open-ended questions, using the Qualtrics survey technology provider, to obtain both quantitative and qualitative responses. Library administrators were contacted to identify relevant library staff to participate in the survey. Pasco County Library System administrators agreed to distribute the survey to their staff. Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative administrators provided email addresses of staff selected to participate. Web sites of the libraries, their counties, and their partners were also examined for additional information. Findings - The results suggest that the libraries are able to satisfy most of the requests of entrepreneurs. One exception was consulting, which was not consistently available, according to respondents, but could be offered at the library by business service organizations. Suggestions for promoting library business resources were proposed, based on survey responses and the websites of the libraries, their counties, and their business service organization partners. Research limitations/implications - This research studied key public librarians and staff employed at Pasco and Hillsborough counties in Florida. Some of the resources identified as useful for entrepreneurs in these counties may not be generalizable to communities outside the state of Florida, or outside the USA. Additionally, the survey did not explore what is not being done or what could be done if the libraries had more resources. Practical implications - This study provides information on the resources and services that public libraries provide entrepreneurs. It also offers suggestions for libraries to become more valuable and visible to their local business community. Social implications - As entrepreneurs and small businesses contribute substantially to economic development, public libraries that provide assistance to them help their communities prosper. Originality/value - This study is a collaboration between an academic reference librarian with a recent MBA degree, and an Entrepreneur Services Manager and Florida SBDC Center Director, who together provide a unique perspective and interpretive value toward promoting economic development.",2015

We used a text-based Foucauldian genealogical discourse analysis to investigate the written statements used by libraries that have adopted BISAC and other aspects of the bookstore model. Libraries adopting bookstore models such as BISAC should consider the potential consequences of adopting a commercial model for a public entity. This paper has practical implications for libraries considering adopting any aspect of the bookstore model, but especially the BISAC system, as it examines the potential benefits and drawbacks of the bookstore model popular in some libraries with respect to the purposes and goals of public libraries. BISAC application in libraries seems to be part of a trend of applying commercial practices, values and terminology in libraries, perhaps not with the purpose of replacing libraries with bookstores, but with the aim for both systems to converge into a new kind of commercial entity and context. The influence of one kind of system over the other does not seem to be totally reciprocal, since the application of library practices, values and standards in bookstores has not had the same effects and resonance as has occurred in the opposite direction.",2014

What is the nature, scope and impact of the services offered by these PAC venues? Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a mixed-methods investigation of libraries, telecenters and cybercafes in 25 developing countries around the world shows that there is a strong ecosystem of PAC venues in developing countries, and that users are shifting away from libraries in favor of commercially driven Internet cafes that provide good customer service and support to meet their information needs. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the benefits of using public-access computers indicates that while users enjoy faster and cheaper access to more sources of information, PAC venues appear to be used more for building and maintaining users' social networks, personal relations and entertainment, and less for education, health, e-government or e-commerce activities.

The research reported in this article provides baseline data concerning the evolving relationship between the public's use of the library and its use of the Internet. The authors developed a consumer model of the American adult market for information services and resources, segmented by use (or nonuse) of the public library and by access (or lack of access) to, and use (or nonuse) of, the Internet. A national Random Digit Dialing telephone survey collected data to estimate the size of each of six market segments, and to describe their usage choices between the public library and the Internet. The analyses presented in this article provide estimates of the size and demographics of each of the market segments; describe why people are currently using the public library and the Internet; identify the decision criteria people use in their choices of which provider to use; identify areas in which libraries and the Internet appear to be competing and areas in which they appear to be complementary; and identify reasons why people choose not to use the public library and/or the Internet. The data suggest that some differentiation between the library and the Internet is taking place, which may very well have an impact on consumer choices between the two.

"McIntosh, Christopher R.",Library return on investment: Defending the contingent valuation method for public benefits estimation,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"Many library return on investment (ROI) studies have been conducted in the United States. Most rely on cost savings approaches to determine the marginal benefits of library services. These methods fail to logically have a meaningful relationship to theoretical benefits estimation. Adaptations of the contingent valuation method (CVM) to this application are discussed in reference to the well-known National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration panel guidelines and recent literature. A CVM technique is used to estimate median annual household benefits for Minnesota public library services. Results indicate that CVM likely leads to more conservative estimates than cost savings approaches, which is probably due to the realities of available substitutes and low patron marginal benefits from additional transactions.

"Campana, Kathleen","As Easy as 1, 2, 3: Exploring Early Math in Public Library Storytimes",LIBRARY QUARTERLY,,"Public library storytimes are recognized as early literacy environments for young children and research has demonstrated their early literacy impact for children who attend. While storytimes hold on to their identity as early literacy environments, storytime providers have moved beyond early literacy by placing a broader focus on school readiness skills. In working to understand the knowledge and skills that constitute school readiness, researchers found that early math skills are the strongest predictor for later school achievement. Therefore, to support school readiness effectively, storytime providers should focus on supporting early math skills in their storytimes through play-based methods. This study was designed to provide insight into the early math environment provided by public library storytimes. The results reveal that storytimes are providing a play-based, early math environment in which children are exhibiting early math behaviors, suggesting that storytimes are supporting early learning more broadly and helping to prepare children for school.",2020

"Stine, William F.",Does state aid stimulate public library expenditures? Evidence from Pennsylvania's enhancement program,LIBRARY QUARTERLY,,"Pennsylvania public libraries began receiving increased allotments of state aid in 2000. In the first two years of enhancement aid, total state aid received by Pennsylvania libraries more than doubled. This reversed the trend of little growth in the years preceding 2000. The enhancement aid program also redesigned certain categories of state aid to increase incentives for local government support. Based on the principles from the economics of grants literature, an empirical model was employed to test the effect of state aid on library expenditures in Pennsylvania counties. Grant response was estimated by employing two separate equations in which library expenditures and state aid were simultaneously determined. It was found that expenditure response was significantly higher in the first two years of enhancement aid than it had been previously. Further, state aid stimulated increased local revenue financing in most years and in most counties. However, the degree of stimulation decreased in many counties during the enhancement period, thus providing them with tax relief.",2006

The growth of serials management companies suggests the possibility of this research. Through analysis of resources tracked by Serials Solutions, Inc., one can get a firm grasp on how many electronic journals a library is tracking, in comparison with the number of print or microfilm titles they have. This article presents the first comprehensive analysis of how many journals public and various types of academic libraries can access electronically, rather than in print. While highlighting the incredible increase in access to information electronically, it also identifies the limitations of the current research, particularly regarding libraries' print holdings. As data collection improves, future research will be more accurate, and will provide a basis for studying both the growth of electronic access to journals and the expected reduction in print access to journals.",2003

Yet scholarly understanding of the relationships between public libraries and democratization is sharply limited. In this article we review historical studies of national public library systems that cast doubt on widely held assumptions that a positive relationship necessarily pertains between the establishment of public libraries and democracy. Based on this historical review and on sociological theories of social capital (e.g. Bourdieu 1986), we develop a theoretical framework intended to facilitate systematic investigation of the contributions public libraries may make to democracy. Using comparative historical and ethnographic methods, we analyze the relationship between public libraries and democratic systems of government in Namibia, Nepal, and Malawi, and find that in all three cases public libraries were established mainly during democratic regimes. However, they were not necessarily established by democratically elected governments directly, but rather because democratic regimes proved to be relatively open to the influence of diasporas and global civil society. We only find evidence of public libraries contributing to societal democratization, as we conceptualize the process, in Nepal and to a limited degree Namibia countries that lack a long-established, empowered elite class. We discuss possible implications of our analysis for library scholarship and its relations to theories of development.",2012

Regardless, 22 percent of respondants still had not heard of the RDA standard until completing this survey. While further training and educational opportunities (along with funds) for catalogers nationwide would help minimize this disparity, LIS schools also can play a role by educating more thoroughly the next generations of catalogers in this newer descriptive standard.

Design - Unobtrusive observation without informed consent. Setting - Public library branches in the greater Vancouver area, British Columbia, Canada. Subjects Reference librarians. Methods - A 19-year-old posing as a high school student approached reference desk staff at 20 public library branches. The student proxy, Angela, was instructed to ask for books on forming a gay-straight alliance at her school and, if there was a full reference interview, to also ask for recommendations of novels that the group might read. She recorded the reactions, both verbal and nonverbal, using Reference and User Services Association guidelines as a template. Library administrators were aware of the potential visits and permitted the research, but the reference desk staff were not aware of a potential visit by the student proxy. The researcher claimed that her method, while deceptive, was necessary to obtain authentic reactions from the library staff. Main Results - Most reference librarians approached by Angela made adequate attempts to assist her, although a few library staff reacted negatively to her query. Half of the librarians reacted positively to the patron's request, with most of the others providing neutral responses. Very few of the librarians actually taught the patron how to use the library's catalog to search for materials, and most of the librarians were unable to find appropriate materials due to not knowing the appropriate search terms. Only three library staff showed overt disapproval of the search topic, such as frowning or rushing to finish the reference interview quickly, with most remaining objective or supportive. Because of the service she received, Angela stated that eight of the 20 libraries were welcoming enough that she thought she would return. Conclusion - The wide range of responses received by Angela indicated that there was room for improvement in educating public library staff on gay and lesbian issues and materials, especially for gay and lesbian youth.",2018

It considers how reviewers writing for standard library review sources (A.L.A. Catalog, Book list, and H. W. Wilson's Fiction Catalog) described these works. Throughout the first six decades of the twentieth century, most gay and lesbian titles remained as closeted in the review sources as did the readers who sought them. Professional training contributed to a librarian's willingness to consider the purchase of such titles, but larger cultural factors shaped the context in which librarians and reviewers worked. While there may have been some intentional efforts to prevent such works from being reviewed, other factors kept books from the shelves, including the privately printed nature of some works, a library's practice of purchasing hardcover rather than paperback books, and the invisibility of gay and lesbian content to heterosexual reviewers. Thus, only the most sensational titles or the most innocuous works tended to find their way to the library's shelves.",2012

"White, Cody",Rising from the Ashes: The Impact of Proposition 13 on Public Libraries in California,LIBRARIES & THE CULTURAL RECORD,,"In 1978 Howard Jarvis was the driving force behind California's Proposition 13, a direct ballot initiative that sought to reform the state's property tax system. Officially titled the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation, Proposition 13 passed on June 6 of that year and not only immediately cut property tax rates but also limited further increases within the state. As property taxes were and still are a primary source of funding for many public libraries, California librarians in the ensuing years struggled to maintain facilities, staff, and collections in the wake of the cuts. Librarians were also forced to expand their advocacy role in order to better quantify and convey the value of libraries to the public at large.",2011

"Gillaspy, ML",Factors affecting the provision of consumer health information in public libraries: The last five years,LIBRARY TRENDS,,BETWEEN 2000 AND 2005 SEVERAL CHANCES have created an impact on libraries that provide consumer health information to the public. They include increased Internet connectivity; quality and amount of consumer health information available; realization that American lifestyles are leading to health problems; maturation of the consumer health movement and greater acceptance of it among health care professionals; emphasis on health literacy; and September 11th. Some changes were notable in 2000 but remain issues for providers of consumer health information. They include the number of health news items available in all media; the aging baby boomers and their impact on health care financing; less time for physicians and nurses to provide health information and patient education during regular office visits; and the popularity of complementary therapies. The impact of these issues on the provision of health information in U.S. public libraries is discussed.,2005
"Glusker, Ann",Urban Public Libraries Do Not Yet Meet Benchmarks for Web Accessibility by Individuals with Disabilities,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,,"Objective - To determine the extent to which urban public libraries in the United States of America provide web sites which are readily accessible to individuals with disabilities with reference to the Urban Library Council's EDGE initiative (specifically Benchmark 11, Technology Inclusiveness). Design - Web site evaluation. Setting - Urban public libraries in the United States of America. Subjects - The 127 library systems, which were both members of the Urban Libraries Council at the time of the study and located in the United States of America. Methods - Using the everyday life information seeking conceptual framework, an assessment of each of the web sites of the purposive sample of public library systems was performed by an online evaluation tool as well as visually and physically to determine web accessibility and, by extension, technology inclusiveness. Main Results - The results of the online accessibility evaluation tool revealed that not one of the sites surveyed was free of errors or alerts. Contrast errors (related to color combinations), missing alternative text (providing text alternatives for visual elements), and missing form labels (thereby preventing screen readers from performing searches and navigating to results) were the most common problems. Results of visual and physical scans revealed that many sites lacked specific links and/or resources for persons with disabilities, as well as noting that the resources available used oblique language and required many clicks to access. In addition, the vast majority neglected to feature links to national resources such as the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. Conclusions - The web sites of urban public libraries are not yet completely accessible for persons with disabilities. At the very least they need coding fixes and ongoing maintenance to address the kinds of issues found by the online web evaluation tool used. In addition, resources for disabled persons should be prominently and clearly linked and promoted. Further research is called for, both in non-urban library systems and in testing a wider range of access technologies. Improvement efforts should acknowledge that web design that improves access for persons with disabilities serves the broader community as well.",2015

"Flaherty, Mary Grace",From Google to MedlinePlus: The wide range of authoritative health information provision in public libraries,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"Public library staff throughout the United States are providing assistance on a variety of health topics. To better understand health information provision in this setting, unobtrusive visits were completed in a total of 73 randomly selected sites in three different states. The query, Do vaccines cause autism? was posed to library staff. In 59% of encounters, material provided did not answer the question. In more than half of visits, public library staff referred to the libraries' print collections, and 69% of the time when print was provided it did not answer the question or it addressed the question with information contradictory to prevailing medical evidence. Referral was made to electronic resources in a quarter of visits, with answers ranging from Just Google it to MedlinePlus is my favorite go-to. When staff referred to or used electronic resources, authoritative medical information on the topic was supplied 79% of the time. It appears that there was no standardization on handling health queries in most libraries that were visited. Given public libraries are trusted institutions providing community access to health information, it is imperative that staff are using appropriate health information tools which are readily and freely available.

Historically, public libraries have been central in providing formal community information, but today such information provision is accomplished largely by informal networks of community service agencies. Thus, the role and the value of the public library in community information provision seem unclear. We find an analogy to this situation in design theorist Christopher Alexander's conceptualization of planned versus natural cities, and we bring this to bear on an ongoing study of public library service provision to the urban poor. This work reveals implications and recommendations for the public library's unfolding role in community information provision: public libraries may no longer be needed to provide formal community information, but they can engage as information shepherds with local community service agencies in informal community information provision.",2017

Field leaders including public libraries in Chicago, Chattanooga, Houston, Louisville, and Toronto have built robust makerspaces, developed maker programming for a diverse range of patrons, connected community experts with library users for the purpose of sharing information, and fostered communities of practice.1 Characterized by open exploration, intrinsic interest, and creative ideation, the maker movement can be broadly defined as participation in the creative production of physical and digital artifacts in people's day-to-day lives. The maker movement employs a do-it-yourself orientation toward a range of disciplines, including robotics, woodworking, textiles, and electronics. But the maker ethos also includes a do-it-with-others approach, valuing collaboration, distributed expertise, and open workspaces. To many in the library profession, the values ingrained in the maker movement seem to be shared with the aims and goals of public libraries. However, critiques of the maker movement raise questions about current iterations of makerspaces across settings. This article highlights critiques and responses regarding the democratic nature of the maker movement, and in particular, the article analyzes ways librarians involved in a prominent public library maker program discursively construct making and maker programming in relation to the maker movement more generally.",2019

At present, digital scholarship and preservation work falls under the purview of information services (IS), a merged information technology (IT) and library division and home to the digital preservation and scholarship (DPS) team. DPS is a multidisciplinary group of undergraduate students, IS staff and various internal and external partners. Design/methodology/approach - By exploring the evolution of digital projects at a small, liberal arts college, this paper will introduce readers to one dynamic path to cultivating capacity and support for digital initiatives within the confines of limited staffing and monetary resources. Findings - Topics and strategies include working effectively with community partners, leveraging existing strengths, building and sustaining a community of practice (CoP), integrating undergraduates as full staff members and navigating cultural change within the library and higher education more broadly. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates a decade of successful innovation and adaptation to the changing landscape of digital initiatives and the library's role in higher education that is rooted in community-centric commitment to social justice. Discussion of these strategies and theoretical frameworks should prove helpful to institutions looking to reimagine traditional approaches to digital archives and scholarship programs.",2018

The authors selected this period because events, such as the 2016 U.S. presidential election, contributed to an increased national concern about media literacy. This study fills a research gap by providing a broader assessment of public library responses to this issue, as most of the published literature thus far stems from academic libraries. An electronic survey solicited data from both a stratified purposive sample and a self-selecting sample of public libraries throughout the United States (U.S.). Analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from sixty-five public libraries revealed several key themes related to media literacy initiatives, including types of initiatives developed, initiatives deemed most successful by staff, community response to initiatives, and reasons for not pursuing initiatives. Findings denote the current state of how public libraries address media literacy and offer practical guidance for those developing media literacy initiatives. Key findings are as follows: lack of staff time is the reason most often cited for not engaging in media literacy initiatives; more effective measurements are needed to assess both community needs and outcomes of library initiatives; fake news is a topic of interest in the community and among library staff; and there appears to be a relationship between staff interest in the topic and perceived interest on the part of the public, which may impact efforts to address the issue. Implications for practice resulting from those findings include engaging in initiatives that maximize service while minimizing staff time involvement; measuring and assessing community interests as well as outcomes of initiatives; using trending topics such as fake news to increase interest in library services; and continuing to increase staff awareness of and training in issues deemed important by the library community.",2019

Methods: School of Public Health master's degree students were sent questionnaires monthly throughout a semester that asked about usage of and barriers to library resources to examine changes over time. Results: Most students utilized library resources less often than they predicted at the beginning of the semester and did not have accurate expectations about which library resources they would use. Although most students encountered no difficulties using library resources, those who did often had multiple problems and seldom sought library assistance.

Geographic information systems (GIS) was used to analyze the demographics and socioeconomics of the geographic market areas around permanently closed library facilities and compared with national averages from the 2000 U.S. Census. The study found a variety of factors lead to closure; however, a lack of use, a sudden reduction in funding, and the opening of another library facility were the most common closure reasons. The actions taken by the community or library system to alleviate the loss of library services and resources depended on the circumstances of each closure. The geographic market areas around permanently closed facilities tended to include poorer and less educated patrons, and more renters than homeowners when compared to the national average from the 2000 U.S. Census. The study presents a methodology using GIS to describe libraries' geographic market areas and illustrates the need for further exploration into reasons for public library closures and the effects of facility site location, relocation, and permanent closure on potential users.

Results indicated that 100% of the youth had access to the Internet from one or more locations, and that although one quarter of the youth accessed the Internet at the public library, the public library was the least frequently used source of Internet access. For youth without Internet access at home, the public library was also the least used alternate source of access. Approximately 69% of the youth reported that they had visited a public library during the school year. Having Internet access at home did not affect whether or not youth visited the library; however, Internet access at home appears to have affected the frequency with which youth visit the library. Youth without Internet access at home visited the library more frequently, whereas youth with Internet access at home visited the library less frequently. Use of the Internet also appeared to have diminished youth's need to use the public library as a source of personal information; however, use of the Internet appeared not to have affected their use of the public library for school work or for recreation.

We approach this as a comparative case study within undergraduate business and master of public health programs at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. These case studies reveal several implications for practice that apply across social and health sciences programs.",2016
"Johnson, Emily M.; Jones, Krista; Eathington, Patricia; Howard, Carmen; Raszewski, Rebecca; Twigg, Naomi M.",NExT: creating an interdisciplinary alliance to diminish informational barriers for public health nursing,HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL,Collaboration; education; continuing; evidence-based library and information practice (EBLIP); nursing; public health,"Background: Public health nurses (PHNs) are challenged in obtaining opportunities to learn evidence-based practice (EBP). An interdisciplinary alliance was created between health sciences librarians and nurse educators to create a continuing education (CE) opportunity. Objective: To measure the effectiveness of CE training for PHNs on the knowledge gained about the EBP process and information resources. Methods: Ten in-person CE workshops were offered to 69 attendees in rural and urban areas. A pre-test/ post-test survey was administered immediately before and after the training that asked participants to rate their perceived knowledge and comfort levels with EBP concepts and resources. Results: Ninety-seven per cent of participants reported the training was a good use of their time. Based on a 5-point Likert scale self-assessment, participants developed new skills (m = 4.06, SD = 0.968) and were able to find evidence-based literature (m = 4.16, SD = 0.980). Participants reported increasing their understanding of EBP concepts and familiarity of information resources. All data were statistically significant at P < 0.001 (95% CI). Discussion: With the interdisciplinary collaboration capitalising on the instructors' disciplinary skill sets, the team was able to create a new effective EBP education intervention for PHNs. Conclusion: Public health nurses were able to increase knowledge of EBP concepts and information resources to utilise in practice or grant development.",2017
"Koontz, CM; Jue, DK; Lance, KC",Neighborhood-based in-library use performance measures for public libraries: A nationwide study of majority-minority and majority white/low income markets using personal digital data collectors,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"The practice of aggregating public library use data to a system-wide level (central library and branches) can mask the library needs of more specific groups of users. This article introduces a study that addressed this need, by identifying libraries serving majority White/low income and majority-minority markets, and surveying those populations to identify types and levels of use. The study is critical for current library research and practices for these reasons: (1) the increasing diversity in race/ethnicity and languages spoken in U.S. communities; (2) low circulation rates exacerbated by increased Internet use; (3) mere existence of a library is critical to optimize use by populations without the library and reading experience; and (4) the recent release of the U.S. Public Library Geographic Database (http://www.geolib.org/PLGDB.cfm) with neighborhood level census and library use data for all U.S. library jurisdictions. The methodologies developed offer potential for the collection of critical data for the public librarian of today. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2005
"Lenstra, Noah",Movement-Based Programs in U.S. and Canadian Public Libraries: Evidence of Impacts from an Exploratory Survey,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,,"Objective - Past research suggests that approximately 20-30% of public libraries in the United States offer movement-based programs, that is programs that encourage, enable, or foster physical activity and physical fitness. Little is currently known about the impacts of these programs, in the U.S. or elsewhere. This study addresses the questions: what impacts do movement-based programs in public libraries have and what variations exist between urban and rural libraries. Methods - The researcher aimed to explore these questions through an exploratory survey of U.S. and Canadian public libraries that have offered movement-based programs. The survey was completed by self-selecting staff from 1,157 public libraries in the U.S. and Canada during spring 2017. Analysis focuses on those portions of the survey that address the impacts of movement-based programs. Results - Results show that throughout North America, public libraries provide movement-based programs for all age groups. The most consistently reported impact of these programs is new library users. Furthermore, on average respondents report that participation in these programs slightly exceeding their expectations. These facts may account for the finding that 95% of respondents report that they intend to continue offering movement-based programs at their libraries. Conclusion - More research using a randomized survey design is needed to better assess this emerging programming area in a more comprehensive manner. Nonetheless, this study provides needed evidence on the impacts of movement-based programs in many North American public libraries. Hopefully this evidence will contribute to more conversations and research on the roles of public libraries in public health and wellness.",2017

"Rubenstein, Ellen L.",I Didn't Learn That in Library School-Experiential Learning in Consumer Health for Future Public Librarians,LIBRARY TRENDS,,"Interest in consumer health information has blossomed since the mid-twentieth century. Consumers have become much more involved in decisions related to their health care and in seeking information about health issues. Public libraries, as community organizations, have a long history of facilitating access to health information, and currently offer important resources such as computers and free Wi-Fi that facilitate access, especially for people who do not have computers or Internet at home. With the ubiquity and ease of access to online health information, however, various challenges arise. Consumers often lack the knowledge or ability to find information or to evaluate critically the information they find. Many public librarians also often have limited proficiency or experience in helping patrons with their health-related information needs. Although there are various opportunities for public librarians to obtain training in health information, library and information science students considering public librarianship are often not aware that there is a benefit, as well as a responsibility, to becoming knowledgeable about health information. This article discusses issues related to health information access as it relates to public libraries, and suggests practice-based options that could be useful for students preparing for careers in public libraries.",2017

This study drew from administrative documents created by the Harlem Public Library as the basis for testing the Change in Historic Institutions (CHI) model. The CHI model envisions change as a process and delineates adaptive versus innovative change while allowing room to discuss impact and perceptions.

"Brown, NE","The shift from apartheid to democracy: Issues and impacts on public libraries in Cape Town, South Africa",LIBRI,,"Providing all citizens with free and equal access to information allows democracy to flourish. Integral to democratic governments, public libraries have both social and political responsibilities. South Africa's 1994 shift from apartheid to a democratic republic makes it an ideal nation through which to investigate the struggles and issues faced as a public library system adapts to a new political structure. South Africa's public libraries did not automatically receive the assumed benefits of the shift from apartheid's oppressive regime of segregation and inequality to a democratic government. Rather, it is a work in progress. South African libraries face social, political, and economic issues such as: unfair allocation of resources, severe social conditions and problems with support from the government including problematic rhetoric within the New Constitution. LIASA (Library & Information Association of South Africa) has admirably begun to fulfill an important role in library development in South Africa. With appropriate funding and support from all levels of government and from local, national, and international library organizations, the public libraries in South Africa can become the beacons of democracy that they are intended to be.",2004

In this article, the author surveys genre fiction's modern-day discontents in the library field, then proceeds to consider a series of candidate justifications currently on offer in the LIS literature in an effort to resolve the alleged conflict between promoting fiction primarily read for entertainment and advancing democratic ideals. Upon revealing the empirical and theoretical inadequacies of each of these extant justifications, the author develops and defends an alternative in which popular fiction-and, more precisely, genuine aesthetic experience-serves as a resource for the development of dispositions necessary to democratic citizenship. Adopting this justification has far-reaching consequences for the ways in which librarians design and provide recreational reader services to adult patrons.",2020

Although common, these programs have received little assessment in the scholarly literature. This article reports on an exploratory qualitative study of the experiences of staff in public libraries in the state of North Carolina that have developed and implemented these types of programs. Across the state, staff report developing a variety of programs that include physical activities for multiple audiences. The diversity associated with this programming area testifies to the creativity of library staff working in and with their communities.

"Kwon, Nahyun",Public library patrons' use of collaborative chat reference service: The effectiveness of question answering by question type,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"This study investigated the effectiveness of question answering by question types in the interinstitutional collaborative chat reference service at a public library system. In particular, this study examined whether subject-based research type questions are answered as effectively as simple factual type questions, and whether local-specific questions are answered as effectively as non-local questions in the inter-institutional chat reference service. Effectiveness was assessed in terms of answer completeness and user satisfaction. The analysis was based on user surveys and corresponding transcripts of 415 chat reference transactions initiated by patrons of a public library system. The study found little difference in the effectiveness of question answering between subject-based research and simple factual questions. However, local-specific questions, such as circulation-related and inquires about local library services, were answered less completely and patrons expressed lower levels of satisfaction compared to non-local questions. These findings indicate problems and gaps in coordinating the inter-institutional chat reference service among participating libraries. Implications to design seamless services in the collaborative service were discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2007

The establishment of children's rooms as a customary feature of U.S. public libraries coincided with bequests to public libraries by the Carnegie Corporation. One such library, St. Louis (Missouri) Public Library, provides an example of how large, urban library systems expanded to included neighborhood branches as well as a central branch building, all of which contained a purpose-built space for work with children. As branch buildings with children's rooms emerged, so did the need for trained children's librarians. Paradoxically, as soon as there were rooms dedicated to children, librarians extended their reach to municipal playgrounds, schools, and other venues outside of the library. Children's librarians found themselves traversing a variety of spaces, serving a diverse population in multiple sites.",2014

Using Robert Cialdini's theory of factors of influence (i.e., commitment and consistency, authority, liking, social proof, scarcity, and reciprocity) as a framework for analysis, findings show that consistency and commitment and authority were relevant and that liking was also important. These findings are consistent with Cialdini's theory, which suggests that the quality of relationships is one factor that can most strongly influence a decision maker. This study gives insight into the factors motivating those involved in public library funding allocation decisions. No prior studies have examined the construct of influence in decision making about funding for public libraries at any level of government.",2014
"Black, Alistair; Pepper, Simon",From Civic Place to Digital Space: The Design of Public Libraries in Britain from Past to Present,LIBRARY TRENDS,,"Inaugurated as, at once, an antidote to the social problems of industrialization and a cultural and scientific helpmate to progress in an industrial society, public libraries in Britain first appeared in 1850 and soon became a familiar feature, not only on the sociocultural, but also the urban-architectural, landscape. Over the past century and a half, changes in the public library built form have reflected changes in the aims of the public library movement, in architectural style and planning and in wider society. The development and symbolism of the public library built form is analyzed in five periods, stretching from the pre-First World War phases of civic architecture and large-scale philanthropic eclecticism, through the interwar period of embryonic modernism, to the post Second World War era of full-blown modernism and the subsequent postmodernism of the digital age. In each of these periods, the public library building can be read as readily as the books they contained.",2012

Public library directors express interest in accommodating these groups if approached but face budget restrictions and local communities that may oppose these gatherings; gay men's book clubs prefer meeting in private homes and other openly gay-friendly environments largely because of the conservatism of cultural institutions in their collective memories. This qualitative study argues that, with consistent dialogues, gay discussion groups can help public libraries achieve their missions of diversifying their patrons, collections, and services, and that public libraries can assist gay communities with establishing themselves in the city or county's history by hosting visible public discussions of gay texts as markers of an entire community's cultural heritage.",2010

Design/methodology/approach The study was designed as a series of VL workshops for young public library visitors. Each workshop collected information about children's existing VL knowledge, introduced them to new visual concepts, and measured their engagement and comprehension of the newly acquired material. The study data were collected via questionnaires and observations. Findings Most of the children who participated in the study workshops showed a solid baseline knowledge of colors, lines, shapes and textures and were actively engaged in instruction. After the instruction, children generally showed an improved understanding of the newly introduced VL concepts and were able to answer questions related to the new concepts, recognize them in images, and apply them in art projects. Research limitations/implications The study relied on a relatively small sample of library visitors in an affluent neighborhood. The findings are influenced by variations in the topics and delivery methods of instruction. The study findings might not be generalizable beyond the US context. Practical implications The study methods and findings would be useful to VL educators who work with children. Social implications As information continues to proliferate in non-textual contexts, VL is becoming an increasingly important educational goal. The study advances a VL agenda and advocates for introducing VL early in life. Originality/value The authors are not aware of any other study that tested VL instruction on a group of very young children in a public library.",2018

Digital infrastructures are then framed as types of boundary object, catering to multiple communities of practice. In order to tend to these boundary infrastructures, a new staffing model has been introduced that of the boundary staff whose primary purpose would be to support these hybrid infrastructures and more effectively integrate them into the general library environment.

"Pell, John",Teaching Systematic Searching Methods to Public Health Graduate Students: Repeated Library Instruction Sessions Correlate With Better Assignment Scores,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,,Objective - The objective of this study was to devise an assessment plan to determine if repeat attendance at two library instruction sessions is statistically associated with overall assignment scores or specific assignment qualities. Methods - The author used SPSS to calculate correlations between attendance and assignment scores and cross tabulations between attendance and assignment item analysis scores. Results - Repeat attendance at two library instruction sessions was statistically associated with higher overall assignment scores and higher scores on specific assignment sections. The effect is statistically significant. Conclusion - Students who attended two library instruction sessions applied skills and concepts practiced in those sessions on a subsequent research assignment. Not all skills and concepts practiced in the session were applied. Acquisition of more technical skills such as Boolean searching may require a greater number of follow-up sessions.,2017

Because librarians filled reports with statistics, narrative, and professional philosophy and exchanged them throughout the country, nearby collections of reports can provide rich and accessible evidence for institutional, social, and cultural history studies. However, starting in the 1920s, library reports began to emphasize themes rather than departmental details, and librarians increasingly communicated through journals. Thus some libraries ceased collecting institutional publications.

The purpose of the program was to have a team of library leaders and innovators in Latvia and Romania committed to designing and creating a stronger public library environment. The GL grantees, 3TD, and Biblionet worked with the MC team to administer and support the program. The program included planning visits and agreements, training at the MC, attendance at a U.S. library association conference, development and implementation of group projects, and follow-up visits and training. Twelve Latvian librarians and fifteen Romanian librarians participated in the program. The training was unique for each country group based on the needs identified in the initial visits and discussions with the GL grantees. Each country group was divided into three teams of four to five members. The teams had to develop an idea for a library project, write a proposal, and then implement the project. After submitting a successful proposal, the teams received a small grant. The result was a cohort of enthusiastic and engaged library leaders who implemented group projects that were positively received in their respective communities and by library colleagues around the country. All the librarians reported gains in their skills and knowledge in several topics. New library services were implemented, including working closely with local government, making more active use of technology, reaching out to seniors, and creating spaces for children and teens.",2015
"MacCall, SL",Online medical books: their availability and an assessment of how health sciences libraries provide access on their public Websites,JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,,"Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the number and topical range of available online medical books and to assess how health sciences libraries were providing access to these resources on their public Websites. Method: The collection-based evaluative technique of list checking was used to assess the number and topical range of online medical books of the six largest publishers. Publisher inventory lists were downloaded over a two-day period (May 16-17, 2004). Titles were counted and compared with the 2003 Brandon/Hill list. A sample of health sciences libraries was subsequently derived by consulting the 2004 Top Medical Schools-Research in US. Nezos & World Report. Bibliographic and bibliothecal access methods were evaluated based on an inspection of the publicly available Websites of the sample libraries. Results: Of 318 currently published online medical books, 151 (47%) were Brandon/Hill titles covering 42 of 59 Brandon/Hill topics (71%). These 151 titles represented 22% (N = 672) of the Brandon/Hill list, which further broke down as 52 minimal core, 41 initial purchase, and 58 other recommended Brandon/Hill titles. These numbers represented 50%, 28%, and 12%, respectively, of all Brandon/Hill titles corresponding to those categories. In terms of bibliographic access, 20 of 21 of sampled libraries created catalog records for their online medical books, 1 of which also provided analytical access at the chapter level, and none provided access at the chapter section level. Of the 21 libraries, 19 had library Website search engines that provided title-level access and 4 provided access at the chapter level and none that at the diapter section level. For bibliothecal access, 19 of 21 libraries provided title-level access to medical books, 8 of which provided classified and alphabetic arrangements, 1 provided a classified arrangement only, and 10 provided an alphabetic arrangement only. No library provided a bibliothecal arrangement for medical book chapters or chapter sections. Conclusions: This study shows that the number and topical range of online medical books is reaching a point where collection-level consideration is warranted to facilitate efficient use and to prevent the problem of split files. However, the results also show that few efforts are underway on the publicly available Websites of the surveyed health sciences libraries to provide the analytical access necessary to meet the structural needs of clinical information seekers.",2006

We used qualitative content analysis to examine their form and content to identify common themes, trends, and ideas. Public services librarians spend much of their time wrestling with nebulous topics such as service quality, customer satisfaction, and user experience. Improvements in these areas necessitate strengthening the quality of the service and the culture in which it's delivered. One approach to establish standards for consistent service delivery is for libraries to implement service philosophy statements. A service philosophy statement also communicates directly with users what they can-and should-expect from the library. Before we could develop and implement a service philosophy statement at our respective libraries, we wanted to understand the specific ways that service philosophy statements communicate service expectations to users. We will describe the series of steps we followed to conduct our research, such as creating the coding frame, segmenting the data, pilot coding, evaluating and modifying the coding frame, analyzing the data, and interpreting the findings. Finally, we will review the challenges we encountered during this process, as well as lessons we learned about qualitative content analysis.",2020

As such, they serve as gatekeepers for their communities. In addition, librarians have included 'children's book reviewer' among their professional titles, serving as gatekeepers for readers at large and as de facto literary agents, and have inspired and nurtured poets and authors. Marilla Waite Freeman exemplified each of these roles in her nearly seventy years as a librarian. She was known for acquiring and promoting new forms of literature and opposing censorship, using motion pictures to encourage the reading of books, and lecturing and writing on modern library service, producing speeches and essays which were required reading in library schools of the day. She is identified as the model and inspiration for the librarian Helen Raymond in Floyd Dell's novel Moon-Calf and was a long-time friend of John Masefield, Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom.

"Asher, Curt; Case, Emerson",A generation in transition - A study of the usage and attitudes toward public libraries by Generation 1.5 composition students,REFERENCE & USER SERVICES QUARTERLY,,"Generation 1.5 students are those who appear fully conversant in American English and culture but are still in the process of learning English when they enter college. This study, based on the findings of a 51-question survey administered to 285 students in a first-year college composition course, examines the effect and role that public libraries have in the success of Generation 1.5 college writers. The findings raise questions about the role public libraries play in preparing students for college. The article suggests reasons for heavy public library use by Generation 1.5 college students, even when academic libraries are available to them.",2008

Then we will explore the importance of school and public library collaboration for children's literacy and academic success. We will examine the ways in which research has demonstrated that public libraries and school libraries can work together when facilities are closed, access is limited, and budgets are cut, and will conclude with the implications for library and information science (LIS) researchers in fields beyond school libraries and youth services.",2009
"Jayakar, Krishna; Park, Eun-A",Funding public computing centers: Balancing broadband availability and expected demand,GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY,Universal broadband; Universal service; Public computing centers; Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP); Internet access; Libraries; Community networking,"The National Broadband Plan (NBP) recently announced by the Federal Communication Commission visualizes a significantly enhanced commitment to public computing centers (PCCs) as an element of the Commission's plans for promoting broadband availability. In parallel, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has channelized part of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) funding to PCCs. However, BTOP funding was the result of an unprecedented economic crisis, and is unlikely to be repeated. Future programs will need to evolve criteria for selecting projects for funding that maximize their cost-effectiveness. We argue in this paper that basing funding for PCCs on broadband availability (or non-availability), is not as cost-effective as considering a broader array of factors related to demand for internet access at public computer centers. We use data on public libraries from the National Center of Educational Statistics to identify factors predicting high demand for internet access at PCCs. Based on this analysis, we argue that low demand markets may benefit more from consumer outreach and digital literacy programs, than from infrastructure deployment. Also, we argue that markets with high availability, should receive more funding if there is high demand as well, as predicted by our model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2012
"Garwood, Deborah A.; Poole, Alex H.",Pedagogy and public-funded research: an exploratory study of skills in digital humanities projects,JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION,Skills; Data handling; Data literacy; Information literacy; Digital humanities pedagogy; Information and library science; Public-funded research,"Purpose Public-funded research in digital humanities (DH) enhances institutional and individual research missions and contributes open data to a growing base of globally networked knowledge. The Digging into Data 3 challenge (DID3) (2014-2016) is an international, interdisciplinary and collaborative grant initiative, and the purpose of this paper is to explore skills that faculty and students brought to projects and others they acquired and shared on collaborative teams. Design/methodology/approach Rooted in the naturalistic paradigm, this qualitative case study centers on semi-structured interviews with 53 participants on 11 of the 14 DID3 projects. Documentary evidence complements empirical evidence; analysis is constructivist and grounded. Findings Hailing from diverse academic research institutions, centers and repositories, participants brought 20 types of discipline-based or interdisciplinary expertise to DID3 projects. But they reported acquiring or refining 27 other skills during their project work. While most are data-related, complementary programming, management and analytical skills push disciplinary expertise toward new frontiers. Project-based learning and pedagogy function symbiotically; participants therefore advocate for aligning problem-solving skills with pedagogical objectives at home institutions to prepare for public-funded DH projects. A modified content analysis juxtaposes DID3 skills with those advanced in 23 recent DH syllabi to identify commonalities and gaps. Originality/value Pedagogy has an important yet under-researched and underdeveloped role in public-funded DH research.",2019
"Adkins, Denice; Bossaller, Jenny E.","Fiction access points across computer-mediated book information sources: A comparison of online bookstores, reader advisory databases, and public library catalogs",LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"One of a librarian's more difficult jobs may be helping patrons in an elusive search for a good book. A variety of online sources are now available to help readers and librarians in their search, but the descriptive capabilities of the resources vary widely. Library and information science (LIS) literature has suggested many schemes and access points for fiction classification. This study compared the records for identical books in a variety of computer-mediated book information sources (CMBIS) in order to find out which resources utilized the access points identified in LIS literature. Results from this study suggest that online bookstores may be effective tools for librarians helping patrons find good books because of their increased use of access points. However, reader advisory databases, which contain reviews and subject headings, are occasionally more effective than online bookstores for identifying books published prior to the 1990s.

From 1898 through 1917, Guerrier worked in the immigrant community of Boston's North End. She established a programme of girls' reading groups that provided access to core elements of a progressive liberal arts education. The most notable of these was the Saturday Evening Girls (SEG). Concurrently, Guerrier established the Paul Revere Pottery, a retail art pottery studio run by the young women of the SEG. Using Guerrier's varied career as a starting point, this paper explores the role of the new woman' as an agent of social change versus social control, progressive library programmes and their promotion of reading material, and issues of acculturation, cultural plurality, and personal agency among immigrant girls and young women.",2016

"Dresang, ET; Gross, M; Holt, LE",Project CATE - Using outcome measures to assess school-age children's use of technology in urban public libraries - A collaborative research process,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"Although outcome-based evaluation was routine in governmental and nonprofit agencies by 2002, it had not been systematically applied to the evaluation of children's services in public libraries. At the same time, digital technology had grown commonplace in public libraries, with 94.5% of libraries providing Internet access to the public in the year 2000. This article examines various definitions and models of outcome-based evaluation; describes the lack of knowledge regarding children's use of technology in public libraries, despite their majority status among users; and presents an original outcome-based evaluation model (the Project CATE model) developed to assess this use. Although this unique, dynamic, and interactive evaluation research model was conceived as a collaboration between the Saint Louis Public Library and the Florida State University School of Information Studies, it is designed to be transportable and applicable in a wide variety of assessment situations.

"Magi, Trina J.",The gap between theory and practice: A study of the prevalence and strength of patron confidentiality policies in public and academic libraries,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"Vermont library directors estimated they received at least 1228 requests for patron information in the last year. In spite of these requests and heightened awareness about threats to confidentiality posed by the USA PATRIOT Act, fewer than half of the state's public and academic libraries have written patron confidentiality policies. The policies that do exist were recently updated and most prohibit release of information without a binding legal document. However, only half require an attorney's review of such documents. Libraries with larger numbers of personnel and with directors holding MLS degrees are more likely to have policies. The absence of policies does not appear to indicate a lack of belief in the importance of confidentiality; a vast majority of library directors support strengthening the state law.

"Clark, Laura K.",Caregivers' perceptions of emergent literacy programming in public libraries in relation to the National Research Councils' guidelines on quality environments for children,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,,"A survey conducted at three Florida library systems examines caregivers' perceptions of emergent literacy programming and how these perceptions compare with the National Research Council's features for quality programs for children. The survey results reveal that caregivers' perceptions of emergent literacy programming align with the National Research Council's features. The data demonstrates that caregivers' perceptions are very positive toward emergent literacy programming in terms of learning and the environment. Caregiver' perceptions of the environment answers were mostly strongly agree. These results were more positive than their perceptions of learning, although they strongly agree that these programs prepare children for school, reading, and social interaction. The survey results will inform public libraries as to how to design, market, and deliver emergent literacy programming to caregivers with very young children.",2017

The implementation of filters creates a range of practical issues for libraries and also raises myriad research issues related to the effects of CIPA on public library services and on access to Internet-based information in public libraries. Using a multimethod, iterative research strategy, this article explores selected areas related to filtering that may affect the provision of Internet content and services in public libraries. This study presents preliminary data about the impact of CIPA on public libraries and offers a perspective of what research is necessary to provide a better understanding of the impacts of CIPA and to determine what research would need to be conducted for potential future legal challenges to the application of CIPA in public libraries.",2004

ADHD is explored here as an information challenge imposed by fragmented views of an ADHD information world. This call to action explores and organizes the transdisciplinary literature about ADHD experiences into a guide that informs the social justice efforts of public libraries/librarians, who can serve as intermediaries between information stakeholders and the vast array of information resources about ADHD. These intermediaries can develop collections and services to support shared decision making among various ADHD stakeholders. To support these efforts, we identify information resources needed by users. More importantly, however, we help libraries/librarians recognize the frames they use to interpret users' information needs for collection development.",2016

The findings indicate that there is very little consensus about what the undergraduate librarian does, how the work is structured on a daily basis, and how its goals are negotiated and assessed. Further, undergraduate librarians face a number of issues, including navigating vaguely defined responsibilities, establishing their professional credibility, and communicating their role within the library and to the university. Survey participants reported experiencing tension between the traditional (reference, instruction, collection development) and undergraduate-specific aspects of their duties, indicating that it is difficult for them to prioritize engagement and outreach. While the literature on blended librarianship anticipates some of these issues, undergraduate librarians are unique because they provide an intersection between broader higher education priorities and the academic library. The author stipulates that the lack of definition, strain, and the perception of undergraduate librarianship as an entry-level position is incongruent with the importance colleges and universities place on undergraduate student success.",2018

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, twenty-eight health care providers in rural areas were stratified by occupation and region, then randomized into either the DynaMed or the AccessMedicine study arm. Study participants were physicians, physician assistants, and nurses. A pre- and post-study survey measured participants' attitudes toward different information resources and their information-seeking activities. Medical student investigators provided training and technical support for participants. Data analyses consisted of analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired t tests, and Cohen's d statistic to compare pre- and post-study effects sizes. Results: Participants in both the DynaMed and the AccessMedicine arms of the study reported increased satisfaction with their respective PoC resource, as expected. Participants in both arms also reported that they saved time in finding needed information. At baseline, both arms reported too little information available, which increased to about right amounts of information'' at the completion of the study. DynaMed users reported a Cohen's d increase of +1.50 compared to AccessMedicine users' reported use of 0.82. DynaMed users reported d2 satisfaction increases of 9.48 versus AccessMedicine satisfaction increases of 0.59 using a Cohen's d. Conclusion: Participants in the DynaMed arm of the study used this clinically oriented PoC more heavily than the users of the textbook-based AccessMedicine. In terms of user satisfaction, DynaMed users reported higher levels of satisfaction than the users of AccessMedicine.",2016
