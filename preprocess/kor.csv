Results show that most of library users (98.8%) expressed the need for Bookstart program. Respondes also said that libraries, rather than other institutions, should be the place where the program is to be implemented. By analyzing the perceptions of library users, we also find that they think that the age of the first use of a library is more appropriate for toddlers than kindergarten-ages. We also found that library users who participated in a Bookstart program had a positive change in the way they used libraries. After participating in Bookstart programs, many changes occurred with respect to the perception of babies, reading habits of parents, and users’ perception of libraries. After introducing Bookstart program, one city library’s membership enrollment rates of babies and toddlers increased from 7.1% to 26.2%. But the rate for another city that did not participate in the program was shown at 4.3%.

The personal value system was measured by Schwartz’s (1992) Theory of Basic Human Values. The theory includes ten universal values, which can be categorized into four higher-order values: namely, self-transcendence vs. self-enhancement; and openness to change vs. conservation. The data were collected on the web from 1,000 Korean adults who were 18 years old or above using a quota sampling method with respect to the distributions of gender, age, and geographic locations of the general Korean adult population. The collected data were analyzed using multi-dimensional scaling method, t-tests, and multiple correlations. The results showed that the public library is more likely to be used by the individuals who value “openness to change” (representing self-direction and stimulation), and “self-enhancement”(representing achievement, power, hedonism/sensuous pleasure) than those who value “conservation” (representing safety, stability of society, conformity to rules, tradition) and “self-transcendence” (representing interest in other’s well-being, and tolerance, welfare of humanity and community). The findings suggest that public library uses reflect the characteristics of major library services, such as reading and self-learning, which are very autonomous and individualistic in their nature.

"Yoon, Hee",Analysis and Solution of Contracting out of Public Libraries in Korea,Journal of Korean Library and Information Science Society,Public Library; Library Management; Contracting Out; Outsourcing; New Public Management,"In most countries the public library run as a public institution and a symbolic icon for a democratic society. Therefore public library's publicity is absolutely essential value and profit should not be made on their maintenance. More recently, as the government's budget spending increase, however, many local governments contract out to manage an entire library or new library system. Three main reasons could be identified. Firstly, alternative solutions for maintenance were supposed to save money. Secondly, contracting out provides an opportunity to improve the quality of service delivery. Thirdly, central government and some local authorities had very strong ideological reasons for contracting out of the public libraries. However, nothing proved that alternative maintenance had caused lower cost and better services in Korea. In this paper, the reasoning of a move from the traditional form of public library governance is discussed, as well as the advantages and disadvantages contracting out of the public libraries, and suggested various practical solutions in Korea.",2008

In the case of basic personnel, it is desirable to have three librarians in all public libraries or considering the fact that the library's non-professional work is about 30-40%, it is also necessary to consider a plan consisting of two librarians (professional + para-professional) and one non-professional. The local representative library should apply the librarian standard of the public library serving a community of 300,000 people and establish a standard to add non-librarian equivalent to one-third of librarians. In the case of additional personnel, it is desirable for public libraries to increase one librarian whenever the service target population exceeds 10,000, and the local representative library to increase one librarian whenever the service target population exceeds 100,000.

Therefore, it is necessary to operate the program by providing exhibitions and performance spaces while providing information and education spaces to users. The librarian should also promote the fact that library can be only the space of information and education, but also the space where culture, healing, experience and communication take place. In addition, libraries should strive to improve user awareness of library space.",2019

Interviews with seven library staff reveal physical accessibility issues including spatial relationships between libraries and other facilities such as shopping malls and schools, travel distance, transportation mode, and temporal perspectives of library access. The results from the interviews corroborate the findings from secondary analysis using household travel data. However, interviewees do not have a clear picture of how much their users travel and spend to access their libraries. This is true, even though these factors are critical to analyze physical accessibility. Based on the findings, this study makes recommendations to improve the accessibility of public libraries. Suggestions include the concept of sponsorships with other facilities, the placing of material drop-boxes on the main route, and providing library programs during lunch time.",2012

The concept of creative zone in public libraries was analyzed on the basis of 'Con-creative structure ontology' by Rombach. As we understand a creator and creation as the relation of 'subject'-'object', The current concept of 'Creation' dilutes the possibility of 'Autogenese' that all beings as a subject possess. But 'Con-creative Structure' describes the process of 'Autogenese' through sharing and mutual communication of all beings. The formation process of Con-creative Structure corresponds to the philosophy of the library that supports the self-growth through communication and sharing. 'Co-working Space' is more suitable for the substantive image of Con-creativity than 'Makerspace'. Therefore, this study analyzed circumstances of creative zone in public libraries and Co-working Space in business areas and provided the conceptive and substantive modeling for Co-working Space in public libraries.",2015

This may not be the reality in some cases as some category of persons may not be properly served by the public library. This study assesses the provision of information materials in alternative format, in terms of its availability, access and level of use by the visually impaired in public libraries in southwestern Nigeria. The study adopted survey research design. Four (4) public libraries in four states were purposively selected because they are the ones that provide alternative format for the use of a sizable number of the visually impaired.

Data from 69.2% of the 166 visually impaired persons that were interviewed, and the observations made were analyzed. The result reveals that alternative formats availability were inadequate and , e-resources were not available while access to formats and information desired by the users were limited. Braille is the most utilized format; audio materials and large prints were seldom used. The demand for alternative formats is high but it is not related to level of use of materials. Provision of information materials in alternative formats for the visually impaired in public libraries cannot support the needs of the visually impaired; it requires intervention from all stakeholders.
